## OSG Software Team

EL9 GPG key had to be recreated again so packages have to be rebuilt.


-   AI (Carl): Debug VMU image generation for EL9;
    CHTC infrastructure staff can answer questions about Kickstart
-   AI (Carl): Rebuild EL9 packages to get signed with the new GPG key
-   AI (Mat): Clean-up work on OSPool Container Universe project
-   AI (TimT): Test HTCondor 10.x on EL9; this requires an EL9 VM or host in order to test cgroupv2 support,
    since that is based on the kernel version
