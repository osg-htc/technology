### Support Update

-   Lancium (BrianL): for Singularity-in-Singularity, GPUs aren't made available if the outer Singularity is < 3.8.0.
    On the plus side, GPUs work for unpriv Singularity in unpriv Singularity

## OSG DevOps

New:
-   Request to inject entire HTCondor job classad into GRACC records.  Will require gratia-probe-condor changes.

Ongoing:
-   Shoveler and Collector is tested, now converting UNL to using the shoveler.
-   Stashcp changes to support authenticated reading from /ospool namespace is done and lightly tested.

Back burner:
-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
