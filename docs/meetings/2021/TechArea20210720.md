### Support Update

- (Derek) SIUE - Discovered bug in gratia probe, fixed locally and submitted upstream: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/pull/107
-   BrianL:
    -   We are currently only sending LIGO jobs to Georgia Tech to avoid having OSG
        (and other VO) jobs run on LIGO pilots.
-   Marian:
    -   Continuing to debug JLab submissions at Georgia Tech.
    -   Lamar (CLAS12) does not have any pilots or show any HTCondor activity.
    -   Finish setting up ICTS; it is registered in Topology so only the factory config needs to be updated.

-   Mat: Lancium not seeing enough jobs again; Brian will investigate further.

## OSG DevOps

-   StashCP go client is working and tested, and being tested by Christina now. Need to talk to Mats on packaging and releasing. (will follow up).  No news from Christina,
-   Design document is done and is being distributed for xrootd monitoring collector NG (next gen).  Shoveler is working and lightly tested.  Now on to the collector.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
-   Discussions of xrootd-multiuser support for checksumming on-the-fly.  After a discussion, the checksum-on-the-fly funcationality will be ported to xrootd-multiuser.  Copied largely from xrootd-hdfs.  This does mean that out-of-order writes will not be supported.
-   More partners are asking about scitokens-cpp, and compatibility.  Expect some updates.
    -   Maybe we have been doing tokens wrong?  Use the `typ` rather than `ver`.

-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.


### Discussion

None this week
