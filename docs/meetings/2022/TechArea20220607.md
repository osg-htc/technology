## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus Friday afternoon
-   JLab FE and VO certs expire next Thursday, Ops may need a reminder to update the certs next week
-   BNL will be submitting EIC jobs via Harvester and will pass along a subject DN that we need added to the `vo-client`
-   Streamline deployments of OSDF caches and origins
    -   AI (Mat): Add topology endpoint serving cache/namespace mappings (SOFTWARE-5179)
    -   AI (Mat): Evaluate state of SLATE stashcache chart (SOFTWARE-5211)
    -   AI (Carl): Add stashcache lookup by resource name (SOFTWARE-4347)
    -   AI (Carl): stash-cache/origin: allow toggling VOMS by environment variable (SOFTWARE-5106)
    -   AI (Carl): authfile generation fails if origin serves no public data (SOFTWARE-5028)
    -   AI (Carl): Authfiles for auth stash origins should include the origin's DN (SOFTWARE-4399)
    -   AI (Carl): Validate OSDF data in Topology (SOFTWARE-4167)
-   AI (Carl): backfill container should shut down upon HTCondor exit (SOFTWARE-4608)
-   AI (Carl): add ability to specify custom workflows in opensciencegrid/images (SOFTWARE-5013)
-   AI (Carl): remove duplicate contact entries in the Topology contact pages (SOFTWARE-5214)

### Discussion

There are several Docker images that are built from individual GitHub repositories instead of the central "images" repository.
They should be moved to the images repo; keep an eye on how well GitHub Actions workflows scale, though.

COManage registration denials seem to be sticky;
if you want to admit someone you have previously denied, you will have to expunge the CO Person record

### Support Update

-   JLab (BrianL): JLab and their ScotsGrid site are seeing low CPU utiliziation from Slurm for CLAS12 pilots.
    They will lift the blacklisting of ScotsGrid to try to gather more info
-   Belle II (BrianL): will be having a meeting this week to discuss token-based pilot submission
-   Texas Tech (BrianL): new backfill container site, working on fixing COManage registrations
-   WeNMR (BrianL): helping DIRAC developers test token-based pilot submission
-   BNL (Mat): Experiencing CA failures with XRootD TPC.  Their CA certificates look fine;
    Mat has requested that they perform some manual tests to try and isolate the error.
    The XRootD developers are Cc'ed on the ticket and can provide debugging assistance.

### Discussion

Sometimes packages get stuck in Ready for Testing state because they are considered "critical" but no external people have provided feedback.
Mat suggests amending our release policy such that critical packages are released after a month without negative feedback, even if no positive feedback has been received.
Tim says that would be better for software that has received VMU testing or has been well tested outside of OSG.
We have an IRIS-HEP metric to increase the percentage of packages tested in VMU; Brian will create tickets.
Also discussed improving coordination of testing between OSG Operations and Software
