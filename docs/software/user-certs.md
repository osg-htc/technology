User Certificates
=================

!!! warning
    This document is for software that will no longer be supported after the OSG 3.5 retirement (beginning of May 2022).
    See the [Release Series Support Policy](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/release-series/) for details.

!!! note
    This document describes how to get and set up a **personal** certificate (also called a grid user certificate).
    For instructions on how to get **host** certificates, see the [Host Certificates document](host-certs.md).

Getting a User Certificate
--------------------------

This section describes how to get and set up a personal certificate to use on OSG.
You need a user certificate if you are going to interact directly with OSG resources or infrastructure,
including activities such as:

- Managing OASIS
- Directly running jobs on OSG resources
- Directly interacting with OSG storage elements
- Obtaining private contact information from OSG systems

Currently, you can get a user certificate from CILogon.
You may also be able to use other CAs to get a certificate; if your virtual organization (VO) requires that you get a
certificate from a different CA, [contact your VO Support Center](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/tree/master/virtual-organizations) for
instructions.

### Know your responsibilities

If your account or user certificate is compromised, you **must** notify the issuer of your certificate. 
In addition, you should update your certificate and revoke the old certificate if any of the information in the
certificate (such as name or email address) change.
For the CILogon RA send email to [ca@cilogon.org](mailto:ca@cilogon.org).
Additional responsibilities required by the CILogon CA are given on [their page](http://ca.cilogon.org/responsibilities).  


### Getting a certificate from CILogon

You will have to obtain your user certificate using the [CILogon web UI](https://cilogon.org/).
Follow the steps below to get an user certificate:

1. Open the CILogon page, <https://cilogon.org>, in your browser of choice
1. First, either search for your institution and select it or scroll through list and do the same.

    ![Institution Selection](..//img/cilogon_select_idp.png).

    !!! warning
        Do not use Google, GitHub, or ORCID as providers since they are not widely supported in the OSG.
        If your institution is not on the list, please contact your institution's IT support to see if they can support
        CILogon.

1. Click the `Log On` button and enter your institutional credentials if prompted.
1. After successfully entering your credentials, click on the "Create Password-Protected Certificate" link
1. Enter a password that is at least 12 characters long and then click on the `Get New Certificate` button.
1. Click the `Download Your Certificate` button to download your certificate in `.p12` format.
   The certificate will be protected using the password you entered in the previous step.


### Certificate formats

Your user certificate can be stored in a few different formats.
The two most common formats used in OSG are the [PKCS12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) and
[PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) formats.
In the PEM format, your user certificate is stored in two separate files: one for the certificate and another for the
private key.
The PKCS12 format stores the certificate and private key in a single file along with an optional certificate chain.
Most OSG user tools will work with both but will try to use PEM files first.   

To convert a PKCS12 file to  PEM files, do the following.  
   
1. First, extract your user certificate from your PKCS12 file by running the following command.  You'll be prompted for the password you used to create the certificate. The invocation assumes that the PKCS12 file is called `usercred.p12`.  After running, the PEM certificate will be written to `usercert.pem`. 

        :::console
        user@host $ openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem -nodes -clcerts -nokeys
        Enter Import Password:
        MAC verified OK
   
1. Second, extract the private key by running the following command. You'll be prompted for two different passwords.  The first prompt will be for the password that you used to create the certificate.  The second prompt will be for the password that will encrypt the PEM certificate that will be created.  As before, the invocation assumes that your PKCS12 certificate is located in `usercred.p12`. After running, the PEM certificate with your private key will be written to `userkey.pem`.

        :::console 
        user@host $ openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out userkey.pem  -nocerts
        Enter Import Password:
        MAC verified OK
        Enter PEM pass phrase:
        Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:

Using Your User Certificate
---------------------------

1. The standard location to place user certificates is in the users certificate home directory in the `.globus` directory:

        :::console
        user@host $ cp mkdir ~/.globus
        user@host $ cp userkey.pem ~/.globus/
        user@host $ cp usercert.pem ~/.globus/
        user@host $ cp usercred.p12 ~/.globus/

1. To generate a proxy use the command `voms-proxy-init`. 

        :::console
      	user@host $ voms-proxy-init

1. (Optional) If user certificates are not in the `.globus` then the path has to be passed to `voms-proxy-init`

        :::console
        user@host $ voms-proxy-init --cert /<PATH TO>/usercert.pem --key /<PATH TO>/userkey.pem

1. In order to find the Distinguished Name (DN), issuer and lifetime of a certificate:

        :::console
        user@host $ openssl x509 -in /<PATH TO>/usercert.pem -noout -subject -issuer -enddate

!!! note
    For admins trying to validate a service add your user DN to the [grid-map file](lcmaps-voms-authentication.md#mapping-users) of the service.
  

Revoking Your User Certificate
------------------------------

If the security of your certificate or private key has been compromised, you have a responsibility to revoke the certificate.
In addition, if your name or email address changes, you must revoke your certificate and get a new one with the correct
information.

If you have a CILogon issued certificate, contact [ca@cilogon.org](mailto:ca@cilogon.org) in order revoke your certificate.
If you received a certificate from another CA, please contact the CA to initiate a certificate revocation.


Getting a Certificate from a Service Provider with cigetcert
------------------------------------------------------------

You may also get a user certificate from a SAML 2.0 Service Provider such as your home institution or XSEDE.
This kind of certificate is short-lived, typically valid only for a week.
Therefore it is not suitable for using in your browser.
However, it is useful for command-line access to site services such as compute or storage.

You will need to use the `cigetcert` tool to get a certificate this way.
Use yum to install the `cigetcert` package from the OSG repositories.

This is a new way of getting a certificate and does not work with all institutions.
To get a list of institutions supported by `cigetcert`, run:
```console
user@host $ cigetcert --listinstitutions
Clemson University
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
LIGO Scientific Collaboration
LTER Network
...
```

To get a certificate, run
```console
user@host $ cigetcert -i "<INSTITUTION>"
Authorizing ...... authorized
Fetching certificate ..... fetched
Storing certificate in /tmp/x509up_u46142
Your certificate is valid until: Fri Apr 13 17:03:13 2018
```
Authentication is controlled by the institution;
depending on the institution, you may need a valid Kerberos token, or will be prompted for a password.

If all goes well, you should see output similar to what's above.
The certificate is created in `/tmp/x509up_u<YOUR UID>`, which is the same place proxies are created by `grid-proxy-init`.

You may specify default arguments in the `CIGETCERTOPTS` environment variable.
This can save you from having to type in the entire institution name every time you want a cert.
For example, to always use FNAL as the institution, put this in your `.bashrc`:
```bash
export CIGETCERTOPTS="-i 'Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory"
```

Your VO may also provide specific instructions for how to best use this tool.
Contact your VO support center for details.

Finally, `cigetcert` has advanced features, such as the ability to load configuration from a server, or store the cert on a MyProxy server.
See the [manual page for cigetcert](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fermitools/cigetcert/blob/master/cigetcert.html) for more information.


### Using cigetcert with XSEDE credentials

`cigetcert` also works with XSEDE as the service provider.
To use XSEDE credentials, you will first need an account at <https://portal.xsede.org>.
In addition, you _need_ to set up two-factor authentication with XSEDE; see their [MFA documentation](https://portal.xsede.org/mfa) for details.
Push notifications using the Duo Mobile app are required.

Once you have set all those up, run `cigetcert` as follows:
```console
user@host $ cigetcert -u <USERNAME> -i XSEDE
```
`<USERNAME>` is your username at portal.xsede.org.
You will get prompted to "Enter XSEDE Kerberos Password."
Enter the password for your account at portal.xsede.org.
You should then get a 2FA authentication request with Duo Mobile; once you accept this, `cigetcert` will issue the certificate.
