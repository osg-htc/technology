Software Development Process
============================

This page is for the OSG Software team and other contributors to the OSG software stack.
It is meant to be the central source for all development processes for the Software team.
(But right now, it is just a starting point.)

Overall Development Cycle
-------------------------

For a typical update to an existing package, the overall development cycle is roughly as follows:

1.  Download the new upstream source (tarball, source RPM, checkout) into
    [the CHTC upstream area](../software/rpm-development-guide.md#upstream-source-cache)
2.  In [a checkout of our packaging code](../software/rpm-development-guide.md#revision-control-system),
    update [the reference to the upstream file](../software/rpm-development-guide.md#upstream) and,
    as needed, [the RPM spec file](../software/rpm-development-guide.md#osg)
3.  Use [osg-build](../software/osg-build-tools.md#osg-build) to perform a scratch build of the updated package
4.  Verify that the build succeeded; if not, redo previous steps until success
5.  Optionally, lightly test the new RPM(s); if there are problems, redo previous steps until success
6.  Use [osg-build](../software/osg-build-tools.md#osg-build) to perform an official build of the updated package
    (which will go into the development repos)
7.  Perform standard developer testing of the new RPMs; this generally means running the VM Universe tests - see below for details
8.  Have another software team member review your testing and give you permission to promote the package
9.  Promote the package to testing — see below for details


Build Procedures
----------------

<!-- TODO not written yet
### Verifying builds through GitHub Actions
-->

### Initial repo setup

1.  Create your own fork of the <https://github.com/osg-htc/software-packaging> repository.
2.  Clone your fork, then add the upstream repository as a remote (replacing `<YOURNAME>` with your GitHub username):

        :::console
        $ git clone https://github.com/<YOURNAME>/software-packaging
        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/osg-htc/software-packaging


### Basic building

<!-- TODO flesh this out -->

1.  Make changes
2.  Make a scratch build
3.  If you have permissions, push directly upstream

        :::console
        $ git push upstream main

    If you do not have permissions, or want your changes reviewed,
    push to a branch on your own fork and make a Pull Request
4.  Make a non-scratch build


### Building packages for multiple OSG release series

The OSG Software team supports two release series in parallel;
many of the packages are identical or very similar between release series,
and you will be making the same change to a package across both release series.

We recommend using a diffing tool such as Meld (Linux) or WinMerge (Windows) that is capable of comparing
directories and not just individual files, to make sure all the changes are carried over.

This is one example workflow, using the "23-main" and "24-main" release series,
and the package "xrdcl-pelican" which is identical between the two release series.

1.  Make changes to `24-main/xrdcl-pelican` 
2.  Make a scratch build (e.g. `osg-build koji --scratch 24-main/xrdcl-pelican`)
3.  Open `23-main/xrdcl-pelican` and `24-main/xrdcl-pelican` in a diffing tool, and copy
    over all the changes
4.  `git add` and `git commit` the changes; committing the changes to both series in the same commit
    means you don't have to write the commit message twice,
    and `git blame` will be accurate for both release series
5.  `git push` to the upstream repo
6.  Make non-scratch builds; use the following procedure to submit both at the same time:

        :::console
        $ osg-build koji --nowait 24-main/xrdcl-pelican
        $ osg-build koji --nowait 23-main/xrdcl-pelican
        $ osg-koji watch-task --mine


If your development process is more iterative and you need multiple commits,
you could do something like the following (using `xrootd` as an example):

1.  Make changes to `24-main/xrootd`
2.  Make a scratch build as above
3.  Commit your changes as a "checkpoint"
4.  Repeat 1-3 as necessary until you think you are ready for a non-scratch build
5.  Copy your changes to `23-main` using a diffing tool as above
6.  You now have two options:

    -   If you haven't pushed, then you can do an interactive rebase to squash your changes to
        `23-main` and `24-main` down to one commit

    -   If you have already pushed, get a log of the recent changes to `24-main/xrootd`:

            :::console
            $ git --no-pager log --oneline --since='last week' --reverse -- 24-main/xrootd

        Copy and paste that to a text editor.
        Then, when you write the commit message for the commit to `23-main/xrootd`,
        reference the commits from that command.
        For example:

            23-main/xrootd: Update xrootd to 5.8.4 and add various patches

            Includes the following commits from 24-main/xrootd:

            8061d7d40 24-main/xrootd: update to 5.8.4; update patches, bring spec file closer to upstream
            13b858dce 24-main/xrootd: add some more patches
            773f57f21 24-main/xrootd: Add TPC worker pool patch

        Keeping the Git hashes will make future archaeology easier.


Testing Procedures
------------------

!!!note
    This section is out of date

Before promoting a package to a testing repository, each build must be tested lightly from the development repos
to make sure that it is not completely broken, thereby wasting time during acceptance testing.
Normally, the person who builds a package performs the development testing.

**If you are not doing your own development testing for a package**, contact the Software Manager
and/or leave a comment in the associated ticket; otherwise, your package may never be promoted to testing and hence never released.

### The "Standard 4" tests, defined

In most cases, the Software manager will ask a developer to perform the “standard 4” tests
on an updated package in a release series before promotion.
This is a shorthand description for a standard set of 4 test runs:

-   Fresh install on el6
-   Fresh install on el7
-   Update install on el6
-   Update install on el7

An “update install” is a fresh install of the relevant package (or better yet, metapackage that includes it)
**from the production repository**, followed by an update to the new build **from the development repository**.

For each test run, the amount of functional testing required will vary.

-   For very simple changes, it may be sufficient to verify that each installation succeeds and that the expected files are in place
-   For some changes, it may be sufficient to run osg-test on the resulting installation
-   For some changes, it will be necessary to perform careful functional tests of the affected component(s)

If you have questions, check with the Software Manager to determine the amount of testing that is required per test run.

### The "Cross-Series" test, defined

The cross-series test may need to be run for packages that have been built for multiple release series of the OSG software stack (i.e. 3.4 and 3.5):

-   On el7, install from the 3.4 repositories, then update from the 3.5 repositories

Viewed another way, this test is similar to the update installs, above, except from 3.4-release to 3.5-development.

### The "Long Tail" tests, defined

These tests may need to be run when updating a package that's also in the old, unsupported (3.3) branch. They will consist of:

-   Install from 3.3-release and update to 3.5-development (on el7 only)

### The "full set of tests", defined

All of the tests mentioned above.

### Running the tests in VM Universe

In the case that the package you're testing is covered by osg-tested-internal,
you can run the full set of tests in a manual VM universe test run.
Make sure you meet the [pre-requisites](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/vm-test-runs) required
to submit VM Universe jobs on `osghost.chtc.wisc.edu`.
After that's done, prepare the test suite with a comment describing the test run.
For example, if you were testing a new `htcondor-ce` package:

``` console
osg-run-tests 'Testing htcondor-ce-3.2.1-1'
```

After you `cd` into the directory specified in the output of the previous command,
you will need to edit the `*.yaml` files in `parameters.d` to reflect the tests that you will want to run,
i.e. clean installs, upgrade installs and upgrade installs between OSG versions.

Once you're satisfied with your list of parameters, submit the dag:

``` console
condor_submit_dag master-run.dag
```

Promoting a Package to Testing
------------------------------

Once development and development testing is complete, the final OSG Software step is to promote the package(s)
to our testing repositories.
After that, the Release team takes over with acceptance testing and ultimately release.
Of course if they discover problems, the ticket(s) will be returned to OSG Software for further development,
essentially restarting the development cycle.

### Preparing a Good Promotion Request

!!!note
    This section is out of date

Developers must obtain permission from the OSG Software manager to promote a package from development to testing.
A promotion request goes into at least one affected JIRA ticket and will be answered there as well.
Below are some tips for writing a good promotion request:

-   Make sure that relevant information about goals, history, and resolution is in the associated ticket(s)
-   Include globs for the NVRs to be promoted (or a detailed list, if it is that complicated, which it almost never is)
-   If you ran automated tests:
    -   Link to the results page(s)
    -   Verify that relevant tests ran successfully (as opposed to being skipped or failing) – briefly summarize your findings
    -   Note whether the automated tests are just regression tests or actually test the current change(s)
    -   If there are **any** failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request
-   If you ran manual tests:
    -   Summarize your tests and findings
    -   If there were failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request
-   If there are critical build dependencies that we typically check, include reports from the `built-against-pkgs` tool
    -   Note: This step is really just for known, specific cases, like the {HTCondor, BLAHP} set
    -   Occasionally, the OSG Software manager will request the tool to be run for other cases
-   If other packages depend on the to-be-promoted package, explain whether the dependent packages must be rebuilt or, if not, why not

For example (hypothetical promotion request for HTCondor-CE):

> May I promote `htcondor-ce-2.3.4-2.osg3*.el*`? I ran a complete set of automated tests <LINK THE PRECEDING TEXT OR SEPARATELY HERE\>;
> the HTCondor-CE tests ran and passed in all cases. There were some spurious failures of RSV in the All condition for RHEL 6,
> but this is a known failure case that is independent of HTCondor-CE. I also did a few spot checks manually
> (one VM each for SL 6 and SL 7), and in each case setting `use_frobnosticator = true` in the configuration resulted in
> the expected behavior as defined in the description field above.
> The `built-against-pkgs` tool shows that I built against all the latest HTCondor and BLAHP builds, see below.
> <JIRA-formatted table comes after\>

### Promoting

Follow these steps to request promotion, promote a package, and note the promotion in JIRA:

1.  Make sure the package update has at least one associated JIRA ticket;
    if there is no ticket, at least create one for releasing the package(s)
2.  Obtain permission to promote the package(s) from the Software Manager (see above)
3.  Use [osg-promote](../software/osg-build-tools.md#osg-promote) to promote the package(s) from development to testing
4.  Comment on the associated JIRA ticket(s) with osg-promote's JIRA-formatted output (or at least the build NVRs) and,
    if you know, suggestions for acceptance testing
1.  Update the JIRA ticket description with a bulleted list describing changes in the promoted version(s) compared to
    the currently released version(s)
5.  Mark each associated JIRA ticket as “Ready For Testing”
