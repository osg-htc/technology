The procedures, conventions, and policies defined within are used by the OSG Software Team, and are recommended to all external developers who wish to contribute to the OSG Software Stack.\n\n\nPrinciples\n\n\nThe principles below guide the design and implementation of the technical details that follow.\n\n\n\n\nPackages should adhere to community standards (e.g., \nFedora Packaging Guidelines\n when possible, and significant deviations must be documented\n\n\nEvery released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system\n\n\nSource code for software should be clearly separable from the packaging of that software\n\n\nUpstream source files (which should not be modified) should be clearly separated from files owned by the OSG Software Team\n\n\nBuilding source and binary packages from our system should be easy and efficient\n\n\nExternal developers should have a clear and effective system for developing and contributing packages\n\n\nWe should use standard tools from relevant packaging and development communities when appropriate\n\n\n\n\nContributing Packages\n\n\nWe encourage all interested parties to contribute to OSG Software, and all the infrastructure described on this page should be friendly to external contributors.\n\n\n\n\nTo participate in the packaging community: You must subscribe to the \n email list. Subscribing to an OSG email list is \ndescribed here\n.\n\n\nTo create and edit packages: \nObtain access to VDT SVN\n.\n\n\nTo upload new source tarballs: You must have a cs.wisc.edu account with write access to the VDT source tarball directory. Email the osg-software list and request permission.\n\n\nTo build using the OSG's Koji build system: You must have a valid grid certificate and a Koji account. Email the osg-software list with your cert's DN and request permission.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Infrastructure\n\n\nThis section documents most of what a developer needs to know about our RPM infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\nUpstream Source Cache \u2014 a filesystem scheme for caching upstream source files\n\n\nRevision Control System \u2014 where to get and store development files, and how they are organized\n\n\nBuild System \u2014 how to build packages from the revision control system\n\n\nYum Repository \u2014 the location and organization of our Yum repository, and how to promote packages through it\n\n\n\n\nUpstream Source Cache\n\n\nOne of our principles (every released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system) creates a potential issue: If we keep all historical source data, especially upstream files like source tarballs and source RPMs, in our revision control system, we may face large checkouts and consequently long checkout and update times.\n\n\nOur solution is to cache all upstream source files in a separate filesystem area, retaining historical files indefinitely. To avoid tainting upstream files, our policy is to leave them unmodified after download.\n\n\nLocating Files in the Cache\n\n\nUpstream source files are stored in the filesystem as follows:\n\n\n\n\n/p/vdt/public/html/upstream/\nPACKAGE\n/\nVERSION\n/\nFILE\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPACKAGE\n\n\nUpstream name of the source package, or some widely accepted form thereof\n\n\nndt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVERSION\n\n\nUpstream version string used to identify the release\n\n\n3.6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE\n\n\nUpstream filename itself\n\n\nndt-3.6.4.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authoritative cache is the VDT webserver, which is fully backed up. The Koji build system uses this cache.\n\n\nUpstream source files are referenced from within the revision control system; see below for details.\n\n\nYou will need to know the SHA1 checksum of any files you use from the cache.  Do get it, do:\n\n\n$\n sha1sum /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/\nPACKAGE\n/\nVERSION\n/\nFILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributing Upstream Files\n\n\nYou must make sure that any new upstream source files are cached on the VDT webserver before building the package via Koji. You have two options:\n\n\n\n\nIf you have access to a UW\u2013Madison CSL machine, you can scp the source files directly into the AFS locations using that machine\n\n\nIf you do not have such access, write to the osg-software list to find someone who will post the files for you\n\n\n\n\nGit/GitHub Hosted Upstream Files\n\n\nIt is also possible to pull sources and spec files from remote Git or GitHub repos instead of our source cache.\nSee the \nupstream dir info\n for more information.\n\n\nRevision Control System\n\n\nAll packages that the OSG Software Team releases are checked into our Subversion repository.\n\n\nSubversion Access\n\n\nOur Subversion repository is located at:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure for offsite users obtaining access to Subversion\n\n\nOr, from a UW\u2013Madison Computer Sciences machine:\n\n\n\n\nfile:///p/condor/workspaces/vdt/svn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current SVN directory housing our native package work is \n$SVN/native/redhat\n (where \n$SVN\n is one of the ways of accessing our SVN repository above). For example, to check out the current package repository via HTTPS, do:\n\n\n[you@host]$\n svn co https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native/redhat\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG-Owned Software\n\n\nOSG-owned software goes into GitHub under the \nopensciencegrid\n organization. Files are organized as the developer sees fit.\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended that each software package include a top-level Makefile with at least the following targets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall\n\n\nInstall the software into final FHS locations rooted at \nDESTDIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndist\n\n\nCreate a distribution source tarball (in the current section directory) for a release\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupstream\n\n\nInstall the distribution source tarball into the upstream source cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackaging Top-Level Directory Organization\n\n\nThe top levels of our Subversion directory hierarchy for packaging are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nnative/redhat/\nSECTION\n/\nPACKAGE\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION\n\n\nDevelopment section\n\n\nStandard Subversion sections like \ntrunk\n and \nbranches/*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPACKAGE\n\n\nOur standardized name for a source package\n\n\nndt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Directory Organization\n\n\nWithin a source package directory, the following files (detailed in separate sections below) may exist:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME\n\n\ntext file\n\n\npackage notes, by and for developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupstream/\n\n\ndirectory\n\n\nreferences to the upstream source cache and other kinds of upstream files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg/\n\n\ndirectory\n\n\noverrides and patches of upstream files, plus new files, which contribute to the final OSG source package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME\n\n\nThis is a free-form text file for developers to leave notes about the package. Please document anything interesting about how you procured the upstream source, the reasons for the modifications you made, or anything else people might need to know in order to maintain the package in the future. Please document the \nwhy\n, not just the \nwhat\n.\n\n\nupstream\n\n\nWithin the per-package directories of the revision control system, there must be a way to refer to cached files. This is done with small text files that (a) are named consistently, and (b) contain the location of the referenced file as its contents.\n\n\nA reference file is named:\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n.\nTYPE\n.source\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nDescriptive label of the source of the referenced file\n\n\ndeveloper\n, \nepel\n, \nemi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTYPE\n\n\nType of referenced file\n\n\ntarball\n, \nsrpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand contain references to cached files, Git repos, and comments.\nwhich start with \n#\n and continue until the end of the line.\nIt is useful to add the source of the upstream file into a comment.\n\n\nCached files\n\n\nTo reference files in the upstream source cache, use the upstream source cache path defined above,\nwithout the prefix component, followed by the sha1sum of the file:\n\n\n\n\nPACKAGE\n/\nVERSION\n/\nFILE\n sha1sum=\nSHA1SUM\n\n\n\n\nObtain the sha1sum by running the \nsha1sum\n command with the source file as an argument, i.e.\n\n\n$\n sha1sum /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/\nPACKAGE\n/\nVERSION\n/\nFILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature requires OSG-Build 1.14.0 or later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe reference file for \nglobus-common\n's source tarball is named \nepel.srpm.source\n and contains:\n\n\nglobus-common/16.4/globus-common-16.4-1.el6.src.rpm sha1sum=134478c56c2437c335c20636831f794b66290bec\n# Downloaded from \nhttp://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/SRPMS/globus-common-16.4-1.el6.src.rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub repos\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOSG software policy requires that all Git and GitHub repos used for building software have mirrors at the UW.\nMany software repos under the \nopensciencegrid GitHub organization\n are already mirrored.\nIf you are uncertain, or have a new project that you want mirrored, send email to \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee also \nadvanced features for Git and GitHub repos\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo reference tags in GitHub repos, use the following syntax (all on one line):\n\n\n\n\ntype=github repo=\nOWNER\n/\nPROJECT\n tag=\nTAG\n hash=\nHASH\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOWNER\n\n\nOwner of the GitHub repo\n\n\nopensciencegrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT\n\n\nName of the project\n\n\nosg-build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAG\n\n\nGit tag to use\n\n\nv1.12.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHASH\n\n\nFull 40-char Git hash of the tag\n\n\ncff50ffe812282552cedae81f3809d3cf7087a3e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe tarball will be called \nPROJECT\n-\nVERSION\n.tar.gz\n where \nVERSION\n is \nTAG\n without the \nv\n prefix (if there is one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nYou can refer to the 1.12.2 release of osg-build with this line:\n\n\ntype=github repo=opensciencegrid/osg-build tag=v1.12.2 hash=cff50ffe812282552cedae81f3809d3cf7087a3e\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a tarball named \nosg-build-1.12.2.tar.gz\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, if the repository contains a file called \nrpm/\nPROJECT\n.spec\n, it will be used as the spec file for the build\n(unless overridden in the \nosg\n directory).\n\n\nGit repos\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOSG software policy requires that all Git and GitHub repos used for building software have mirrors at the UW.\nMany software repos under the \nopensciencegrid GitHub organization\n are already mirrored.\nIf you are uncertain, or have a new project that you want mirrored, send email to \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can use a shorter syntax for GitHub repos -- see above.\n\n\nSee also \nadvanced features for Git and GitHub repos\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo reference tags in Git repos, use the following syntax (all on one line):\n\n\n\n\ntype=git url=\nURL\n name=\nNAME\n tag=\nTAG\n hash=\nHASH\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL\n\n\nLocation of the Git repo\n\n\nhttps://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n\n\nName of the software (optional)\n\n\nosg-build\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAG\n\n\nGit tag to use\n\n\nv1.11.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHASH\n\n\nFull 40-char Git hash of the tag\n\n\n5bcf48c442d21b1e8c93a468d884f84122f7cc9e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNAME\n is optional; if not present, OSG-Build will use the last component of the URL, without the \n.git\n suffix.\n\n\nThe tarball will be called \nNAME\n-\nVERSION\n.tar.gz\n where \nVERSION\n is \nTAG\n without the \nv\n prefix (if there is one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe reference file for \nosg-build\n's repo is named \nosg.github.source\n and contains:\n\n\ntype=git url=https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build.git name=osg-build tag=v1.11.2 hash=5bcf48c442d21b1e8c93a468d884f84122f7cc9e\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a tarball named \nosg-build-1.11.2.tar.gz\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, if the repository contains a file called \nrpm/\nNAME\n.spec\n, it will be used as the spec file for the build\n(unless overridden in the \nosg\n directory).\n\n\nTypical workflow when building out of GitHub repos\n\n\n\n\nFork the repository of the package that you would like to build\n\n\nCreate a new branch in your fork\n\n\nMake, commit, and push changes to your new branch\n\n\nIn your fork, tag the commit that you would like to build\n\n\nIn the \nupstream/osg.github.source\n, change the repo to point at your fork and tag\n\n\nAttempt a scratch build\n\n\nIf the build fails, remove the tag and repeat steps 3-6\n\n\nSubmit a PR to merge changes upstream\n\n\nTag the final version on the upstream fork\n\n\nBuild the version that will go through the normal software cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPackaging-only changes should be tagged with a release number of the format \nv\nversion\n-\nrelease\n, e.g. \nv3.4.23-2\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced features for Git and GitHub repos\n\n\nThe following features make software development in Git and GitHub more convenient:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for RPM release numbers in Git tags:\n\n\nIf the tag for the software contains a dash, as in \nv1.12.2-1\n,\nit is assumed that the text after the dash is the RPM release instead of the software version.\nThe RPM release is not included in the tarball.\nThat is, the project \nosg-build\n with the tag \nv1.12.2-1\n will result in a tarball named \nosg-build-1.12.1.tar.gz\n,\nnot \nosg-build-1.12.1-1.tar.gz\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan specify tarball name in the .source file:\n\n\nThe new \ntarball\n attribute allows you to specify the name of the tarball and directory that the repo contents will be put into.\nThe syntax is \ntarball=\nNAME\n.tar.gz\n.\nThe extension must be \n.tar.gz\n, no other archive formats are supported.\nThe directory inside the tarball will then be \nNAME\n/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan ignore hash mismatch (scratch and local builds only):\n\n\nFor local builds (rpmbuild and mock tasks) and Koji scratch builds, a hash mismatch will result in a warning.\nNon-scratch Koji builds will still consider it an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan use a branch as the tag:\n\n\nThe \ntag\n attribute can refer to a branch instead of a tag, e.g. \ntag=master\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining the last two features can really speed up package development.\nFor example, you can use this to make scratch builds of the current master:\n\n\ntype=github repo=\nOWNER\n/\nPROJECT\n tarball=\nPROJECT\n-\nVERSION\n.tar.gz tag=master hash=0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis might also be useful as part of a continuous integration scheme (e.g. Travis-CI).\n\n\nosg\n\n\nThe \nosg\n directory contains files that are owned by the OSG Software Team and that are used to create the final, released source package. It may contain a variety of development files:\n\n\n\n\nAn RPM \n.spec\n file, which overrides any spec file from a referenced source\n\n\nPatch (\n.patch\n) or replacement files, which override any same-named file from the top-level directory of a referenced source\n\n\nOther files, which must be explicitly placed into the package by the spec file\n\n\n\n\nGenerated directories\n\n\nThe following directories may be generated by our build tool, \nOSG-Build\n. They are not under revision control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_upstream_srpm_contents/\n\n\nexpanded contents of a cached upstream source package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_upstream_tarball_contents/\n\n\nexpanded contents of all cached upstream source tarballs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_final_srpm_contents/\n\n\nthe final contents of the OSG source package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_build_results/\n\n\nOSG source and binary packages resulting from a build\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quilt/\n\n\nexpanded, patched contents of the upstream sources, as generated by the \nquilt\n tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_upstream_srpm_contents\n\n\nThe \n_upstream_srpm_contents\n directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source package. It is a volatile record of the upstream source for developer use.\n\n\n_upstream_tarball_contents\n\n\nThe \n_upstream_tarball_contents\n directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source tarballs. It is generated by the package build tool if the \n--full-extract\n option is passed. It is not used for anything by the build tool, but meant as a convenience to allow the developer to look inside the upstream sources (for making patches, etc.).\n\n\n_final_srpm_contents\n\n\nThe \n_final_srpm_contents\n directory contains the final files that are part of the released source package. It is a volatile record of a build for developer use.\n\n\n_build_results\n\n\nThe \n_build_results\n directory contains the source and binary RPMs that are produced by a local build. It is a volatile record of a build for developer use.\n\n\n_quilt\n\n\nThe \n_quilt\n directory contains the unpacked sources after they have been patched using the \nquilt\n utility. This allows easier patch development.\n\n\nPackaging Organization Examples\n\n\nUse Case 1: Packaging an Upstream Source Tarball\n\n\nWhen the OSG Software Team packages an upstream source tarball, for which there is no existing package, the source tarball is referenced with a .source file and we provide a spec file and, if necessary, patches. For example, RSV is provided as a source tarball only. Its package directory contains:\n\n\n\n\nrsv/\n    osg/\n        rsv.spec\n    upstream/\n        developer.tarball.source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Case 2: Passing Through a Source RPM\n\n\nWhen the OSG Software Team simply provides a copy of an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and that is it. For example, we do not modify the \nglobus-common\n source RPM from EPEL. Its package directory contains:\n\n\n\n\nglobus-common/\n    upstream/\n        epel.srpm.source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Case 3: Modifying a Source RPM\n\n\nWhen the OSG Software Team modifies an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and then all changes to the upstream source are contained in the \nosg\n directory. For example, we use this mechanism for the \nglobus-ftp-client\n package, originally obtained from EPEL. Its package directory contains:\n\n\n\n\nglobus-ftp-client/\n    osg/\n        globus-ftp-client.spec\n        1853-ssh-bin.patch\n    upstream/\n        epel.srpm.source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild Process\n\n\n\n\nAll necessary information to create the package will be committed to the VDT source code repository (see below)\n\n\nThe \nOSG build tools\n will take those files, create a source RPM, and submit it to our Koji build system\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers may use \nrpmbuild\n and \nmock\n for faster iterative development before submitting the package to Koji. \nosg-build\n may be used as a wrapper script around \nrpmbuild\n and \nmock\n.\n\n\nOSG Software Repository\n\n\nOSG Operations maintains the Yum repositories that contain our source and binary RPMs at \nhttps://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/\n and are mirrored at other institutions as well.\n\n\nRelease Levels\n\n\nEvery package is classified into a release level based on the amount of testing it has undergone and our confidence in\nits stability.\nWhen a package is first built, it goes into the lowest level (\nosg-development\n).\nThe members of the OSG Software and Release teams may promote packages through the release levels, as per our\n\nRelease Policy page\n.\n\n\nPackaging Conventions\n\n\nIn addition to adhering to the \nFedora Packaging Guidelines\n (FPG), we have a few rules and guidelines of our own:\n\n\n\n\nWhen we pass-through an RPM and make any changes to it (so it has an updated package number), we construct the version-release as follows:\n\n\nThe version of the original RPM remains unchanged\n\n\nThe release is composed of three parts: ORIGINALRELEASE.OSGRELEASE\n\n\nWe add a distro tag based on the OSG major version and OS major version, e.g. \"osg33.el6\". (Use \n%{?dist}\n in the Release field)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: We copy package foobar-3.0.5-1 from somewhere. We need to patch it, so the full name-version-release (NVR) for OSG 3.3 on EL 6 becomes \nfoobar-3.0.5-1.1.osg33.el6\n Note that we added \".1.osg33.el6\" to the release number. If we update our packaging (but still base on foobar-3.0.5-1), we change to \".2.osg33.el6\". In the spec file, this would look like:\n\n\nRelease\n:\n 1.2\n%{?dist}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackaging for Multiple Distro Versions\n\n\nConditionalizing spec files\n\n\nSome packages may need different build behavior between major versions of the OS; RPM conditional statements will be used to handle this.\n\n\nThe following macros are defined:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nValue (EL6)\n\n\nValue (EL7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%rhel\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%el6\n\n\n1\n\n\nundefined\n or \n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%el7\n\n\nundefined\n or \n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how to use them:\n\n\n%if\n 0%{?el6}\n\n# this code will be executed on EL 6 only\n\n\n%endif\n\n\n\n%if\n 0%{?el7}\n\n# this code will be executed on EL 7 only\n\n\n%endif\n\n\n\n%if\n 0%{?rhel} \n= 7\n\n# this code will be executed on EL 7 and newer\n\n\n%endif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(There does not seem to be an \n%elseif\n).\n\n\nThe syntax \n%{?el6}\n expands to the value of the \n%el6\n macro if it is defined, and to the empty string if not; the \n0\n is there to keep the condition from being empty in the \n%if\n statement if the macro is not defined.\n\n\nRenaming or Removing Packages\n\n\nOccasionally we want to cause a package to be removed on update, or replaced by a package with a different name.\n\n\nFor the most part, the \nFedora Packaging Guidelines page on renames\n shows how to do that.\nThe exception is that we do not have the equivalent of a \nfedora-obsolete-packages\n package, so in order to force the removal of an entire package (not a subpackage), we have to dummy out the package instead -- see below.\n(This should be a rare situation.)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAfter doing a rename or a removal, you must update all the packages and subpackages that require the package being removed or renamed, and change or remove the requirements as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nTo find packages that require the old package at run time, set up a host with the OSG repos and install the \nyum-utils\n RPM.\nThen, run:\n\n\n$\n repoquery --plugins --whatrequires \n$OLDPACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find packages that require the old package at build time, install \nosg-build\n, and do this from a checkout of the OSG repos:\n\n\n$\n osg-build prebuild *\n\n$\n \nfor\n srpm in */_final_srpm_contents/*.src.rpm\n;\n \ndo\n \n\\\n\n    \necho\n \n***** \n$srpm\n *****\n;\n \n\\\n\n    rpm -q --requires -p \n$srpm\n \n|\n grep -w \n$OLDPACKAGE\n;\n \n\\\n\n  \ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(examine the output to avoid false matches)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCarefully test these changes, including places where the old package may be brought in indirectly.\n\n\n\n\nDummying out a package\n\n\nIn order to forcibly remove an entire package with no replacement, you have to replace the package with one that does nothing.\nThis is because there is no package that will \"obsolete\" the old package.\n\n\nDo the following for the main package and any subpackages it may have:\n\n\n\n\nChange the Summary to \"Dummy package\"\n\n\n\n\nChange the %description to:\n\n\n\n\nThis is an empty package created for $REASONS\nIt may safely be removed.\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n$REASONS\n is a description of why you need this dummy package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove all Requires and Obsoletes lines\n\n\n\n\nDo not remove Provides lines\n\n\nRemove %pre and %post scriptlets\n\n\nUnless there is a good reason not to, remove %preun and %postun scriptlets\n\n\nEmpty the %files section",

You may specify a different set of repos with \n--repo\n, described later. RPMs from the osg-minefield repositories are regularly pulled to the osg-development repositories hosted by the GOC at \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org\n Unless you specify otherwise (by passing \n--el6\n, \n--el7\n or specifying a different koji tag/target), the package will be built for both el6 and el7. This is the method used to build final versions of packages you expect to ship.\n\n\nlint\n\n\nPrebuilds the final source package, then runs \nrpmlint\n on it to check for various problems. You will need to have \nrpmlint\n installed. People on UW CSL machines should add \n/p/vdt/workspace/rpmlint\n to their $PATH.\n\n\nmock\n\n\nPrebuilds the final source package, then builds it locally using \nmock\n, and stores the resulting source and binary RPMs in the package-specific \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\nprebuild\n\n\nPrebuilds the final source package from upstream sources (if any) and local files (if any).

See \nQuilt documentation (PDF link)\n for more information on quilt; also look at the example in the Usage Patterns section below. Similar to \nprepare\n (in fact, \nquilt\n calls \nrpmbuild -bp\n behind the scenes), but the source tree is in pre-patch state, and various quilt commands can be used to apply and modify patches.

The prefix must be a valid URI starting with either \nhttp\n, \nhttps\n, or \nfile\n, or one of the following special values:\n\n\n\n\nAFS (corresponds to \nfile:///p/vdt/public/html/upstream\n, which is the location of the VDT cache using AFS from a UW CS machine).\n\n\nVDT (corresponds to \nhttp://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream\n, which is the location of the VDT cache from off-site).\n\n\nAUTO (AFS if available, VDT if not)\n\n\n\n\nThe upstream source cache must be organized as described above. All files referenced by \n.source\n files in the affected packages must exist in the cache, or a runtime error will occur.\n\n\nDefault is \nAUTO\n.\n\n\nHas no effect with the \n--vcs\n flag.\n\n\n--el6, --el7, --redhat-release \nversion\n (Config: redhat_release)\n\n\nSets the distro version to build for. This affects the %dist tag, the mock config, and the default koji tag and target (unless otherwise specified).\n\n\n--el6\n is equivalent to \n--redhat-release 6\n\n\n--el7\n is equivalent to \n--redhat-release 7\n\n\n--loglevel \nloglevel\n\n\nSets the verbosity of the script. Valid values are: \ndebug\n, \ninfo\n, \nwarning\n, \nerror\n and \ncritical\n.\n\n\nDefault is \ninfo\n.\n\n\n-q, --quiet\n\n\nDo not display as much information. Equivalent to \n--loglevel warning\n\n\n-v, --verbose\n\n\nDisplay more information. Equivalent to \n--loglevel debug\n\n\n-w, --working-directory \npath\n\n\nUse \npath\n as the root directory of the files created by the script. For example, if \npath\n is \n$HOME/working\n, and the package being built is \nndt\n, the following tree will be created:\n\n\n\n\n$HOME/working/ndt/_upstream_srpm_contents\n\n\n$HOME/working/ndt/_upstream_tarball_contents\n\n\n$HOME/working/ndt/_final_srpm_contents\n\n\n$HOME/working/ndt/_build_results\n\n\n\n\nIf \npath\n is \nTEMP\n, a randomly named directory under \n/tmp\n is used as the working directory.\n\n\nThe default setting is to use the package directory as the working directory.\n\n\nHas no effect with the \n--vcs\n flag.\n\n\nOptions specific to prebuild task\n\n\n--full-extract\n\n\nIf set, all upstream tarballs will be extracted into \n_upstream_tarball_contents/\n during the prebuild step. This flag is now mostly redundant with the \nprepare\n and \nquilt\n tasks.\n\n\nOptions specific to rpmbuild and mock tasks\n\n\n--distro-tag \ndist\n\n\nSets the distribution tag added on to the end of the release in the RPM ( \nrpmbuild\n and \nmock\n tasks only ).\n\n\nDefault is \n.osg.el6\n or \n.osg.el7\n\n\n-t, --target-arch \narch\n\n\nSpecify an architecture to build packages for ( \nrpmbuild\n and \nmock\n tasks only ).\n\n\nDefault is unspecified, which builds for the current machine architecture.\n\n\nOptions specific to mock task\n\n\n--mock-clean, --no-mock-clean\n\n\nEnable/disable deletion of the mock buildroot after a successful build.\n\n\nDefault is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n-m, --mock-config \npath\n\n\nSpecifies the \nmock\n configuration file to use. This file details how to set up the build environment used by mock for the build, including Yum repositories from which to install dependencies and certain predefined variables (e.g., the distribution tag \n%dist\n).\n\n\nSee also \n--mock-config-from-koji\n.\n\n\n--mock-config-from-koji \nbuild tag\n\n\nCreates a mock config from a Koji build tag. This is the most accurate way to replicate the build environment that Koji will provide (outside of Koji). The build tag is based on the distro version (el6, el7) and the OSG major version (3.3, 3.4). For 3.4 on el6, it is: \nosg-3.4-el6-build\n Also requires the Koji command-line tools (package \nkoji\n), obtainable from the osg repositories. Since this uses koji, some of the koji-specific options may apply, namely: \n--koji-backend\n, \n--koji-login\n, and \n--koji-wrapper\n.\n\n\nOptions specific to koji task\n\n\n--dry-run\n\n\nDo not actually run koji, merely show the command(s) that will be run. For debugging purposes.\n\n\n--getfiles, --get-files\n\n\nFor scratch builds without \n--vcs\n only. Download the resulting RPMs and logs from the build into the \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\n-k, --kojilogin, --koji-login \nlogin\n\n\nSets the login to use for the koji task. This should most likely be your CN. If not specified, will extract it from your client cert (\n~/.osg-koji/client.crt\n or \n~/.koji/client.crt\n).\n\n\n--koji-target \ntarget\n\n\nThe koji target to use for building.\n\n\nDefault is \nosg-el6\n for el6 and \nosg-el7\n for el7.\n\n\n--koji-tag \ntag\n\n\nThe koji tag to add packages to. See the \nKoji Workflow guide\n for more information on the terminology. The special value \nTARGET\n uses the destination tag defined in the koji target.\n\n\nDefault is \nosg-el6\n or \nosg-el7\n.\n\n\n--ktt, --koji-tag-and-target \narg\n\n\nShorthand for setting both --koji-tag and --koji-target to \narg\n.\n\n\n--koji-wrapper, --no-koji-wrapper\n\n\nEnable/disable use of the \nosg-koji\n wrapper script around koji. See below for a description of \nosg-koji\n.\n\n\nDefault is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n--koji-backend \nbackend\n\n\nSpecifies the method osg-build will use to interface with Koji. This can be \nshell\n or \nkojilib\n.\n\n\n--wait, --no-wait, --nowait\n\n\nWait for koji tasks to finish. Bad for running multiple builds in a single command, since you will have to type in your passphrase for the first one, wait for it to complete, then type in your passphrase for the second one, wait for it to complete, etc. If you want to wait for multiple tasks to finish, use the \nkoji watch-task\n command or look at the website \nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\n--wait\n used to be the default until \nosg-build-1.1.3\n\n\n--regen-repos\n\n\nStart a \nregen-repo\n koji task on the build tag after each koji build, to update the build repository used for the next build. Not useful unless you are launching multiple builds. This enables you to launch builds that depend on each other. Doesn't work too well with \n--no-wait\n, since the next build may be started before the regen-repo task is complete. Waiting will keep the next build from being queued until the regen-repo is complete.\n\n\n--scratch, --no-scratch\n\n\nPerform scratch builds. A scratch build does not go into a repository, but the name-version-release (NVR) of the created RPMs are not considered used, so the build may be modified and repeated without needing a release bump. This has the same use case as the mock task: creating packages that you want to test before releasing. If you do not have a machine with mock set up, or want to test exactly the environment that Koji provides, scratch builds might be more convenient.\n\n\n--vcs, --no-vcs, --svn, --no-svn\n\n\nHave Koji check the package out from a version control system instead of creating an SRPM on the local machine and submitting that to Koji. Currently, SVN and Git are supported. If this flag is specified, you may use SVN URLs or URL@Revision pairs to specify the packages to build. You may continue specify package directories from an SVN checkout, in which case osg-build will use \nsvn info\n to find the right URL@Revision pair to use and warn you about uncommitted changes. osg-build will also warn you about an outdated working directory.\n\n\n--vcs\n defaults to \ntrue\n for non-scratch builds, and \nfalse\n for scratch builds.\n\n\n--repo=\ndestination repository\n, --upcoming\n\n\nSelects the repositories (osg-3.3, upcoming, etc.) to build packages for. Currently valid repositories are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg\n\n\nOSG Software development repos for trunk (this is the default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-3.3 (or just 3.3)\n\n\nOSG Software development repos for 3.3 branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupcoming\n\n\nOSG Software development repos for upcoming branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninternal\n\n\nOSG Software internal branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhcc\n\n\nHolland Computing Center (Nebraska) testing repos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--upcoming\n is an alias for \n--repo=upcoming\n\n\nNote that the repo selection affects which VCS paths you are allowed to build from. For example, you are not allowed to build from branches/osg-3.3 (from the OSG SVN) into the 'osg' repo, or from HCC's git repositories into the 'upcoming' repo.\n\n\nkoji-tag-diff\n\n\nThis script displays the differences between the latest packages in two koji tags.\n\n\nExample invocation: \nkoji-tag-diff osg-3.4-el6-development osg-3.4-el7-testing\n\n\nThis prints the packages that are in osg-3.4-el6-development but not in osg-3.4-el7-testing, or vice versa.\n\n\nosg-build-test\n\n\nThis script runs automated tests for \nosg-build\n. Only a few tests have been implemented so far.\n\n\nosg-import-srpm\n\n\nThis is a script to fetch an SRPM from a remote site, copy it into the upstream cache on AFS, and create an SVN package dir (if needed) with an \nupstream/*.source\n file. By default it will put downloaded files into the VDT upstream cache (/p/vdt/public/html/upstream), but you can pass \n--upstream-root=\nUPSTREAM DIR\n to put them somewhere else. If called with the \n--extract-spec\n or \n-e\n argument, it will extract the spec file from the SRPM and place it into the \nosg\n subdir in SVN. If called with the \n--diff-spec\n or \n-d\n argument, it will extract the spec file and compare it to the existing spec file in the \nosg\n subdir. \nThe script hasn't been touched in a while and needs a good deal of cleanup.\n A planned feature is to allow doing a three-way diff between the existing RPM before OSG modifications, the new RPM before OSG modifications and the existing RPM after OSG modifications.\n\n\nosg-koji\n\n\nThis is a wrapper script around the \nkoji\n command line tool. It automatically specifies parameters to access the OSG's koji instance, and forces SSL authentication. It takes the same parameters as \nkoji\n and passes them on.\n\n\nAn additional command, \nosg-koji setup\n exists, which performs the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a koji configuration in \n~/.osg-koji\n\n\nCreate a CA bundle for verifying the server.\n    Use either files in \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n, or (if those are not found), from files downloaded from the DOEGrids and DigiCert sites.\n\n\nCreate a client cert file. This can be a symlink to your grid proxy, or it can be a file created from your grid public and private key files.\n    The location of those files can be specified by the \n--usercert\n and \n--userkey\n arguments.\n    If unspecified, \nusercert\n defaults to \n~/.globus/usercert.pem\n, and \nuserkey\n defaults to \n~/.globus/userkey.pem\n.\n\n\n\n\nosg-promote\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nRun this script to push packages from one set of repos to another (e.g. from development to testing), according to the OSG software promotion guidelines.\n\n\nOnce the packages are promoted, the script will generate code to cut and paste into a JIRA comment.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\n\n\n\nosg-promote [-r|--route \nROUTE\n]... [options] \nPACKAGE OR BUILD\n [...]\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromote the latest build of \nosg-version\n to testing for the current release series  \n\n\nosg-promote -r testing osg-version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromote the latest builds of \nosg-ce\n to testing for the 3.3 and 3.4 release series  \n\n\nosg-promote -r 3.3-testing -r 3.4-testing osg-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromote \nosg-build-1.5.0-1\n to testing for the current release series  \n\n\nosg-promote -r testing osg-build-1.5.0-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n-h\n\n\nDisplay help and a list of valid routes.\n\n\npackage or build\n\n\nA package (e.g. \nosg-version\n) or build (e.g. \nosg-version-3.3.0-1.osg33.el6\n) to promote. You may omit the dist tag (the \n.osg33.el6\n part).\n\n\nIf a package is specified, the most recent version of that package will be promoted.\n\n\nIf a build is specified, that build and the build that has the same \nversion\n-\nrelease\n for the other distro version(s) will be promoted. That is, if you specify the route \n3.3-testing\n and the build \nfoo-1-1\n, then \nfoo-1-1.osg33.el6\n and \nfoo-1-1.osg33.el7\n will be promoted.\n\n\nThis may be specified multiple times, to promote multiple packages. The NVRs of each set of builds for a package \nmust\n match.\n\n\n-r \nROUTE\n, --route \nROUTE\n\n\nThe promotion route to use. Use \nosg-promote -h\n to get a list of valid routes. This may be specified multiple times. For example, to promote for both 3.4 and 3.3, pass \n-r 3.4-testing -r 3.3-testing\n.\n\n\nIf not specified, the \ntesting\n route is used, which corresponds to the testing route for the latest release series.\n\n\n-n, --dry-run\n\n\nDo not promote, just show what would be done.\n\n\n--el6-only / --el7-only\n\n\nOnly promote packages for el6 / el7.\n\n\n--no-el6 / --no-el7\n\n\nDo not promote packages for el6 / el7.\n\n\n--ignore-rejects\n\n\nIgnore rejections due to version mismatch between dvers or missing package for one dver.\n\n\n--regen\n\n\nRegenerate the destination repos after promoting.\n\n\n-y, --assume-yes\n\n\nDo not prompt before promotion.\n\n\nCommon Usage Patterns\n\n\nVerify that all files necessary to build the package are in the right place\n\n\nRun \nosg-build prebuild \nPACKAGEDIR\n.\n\n\nFetch and extract all source files for examination\n\n\nRun \nosg-build prebuild --full-extract \nPACKAGEDIR\n. Look inside the \n_upstream_tarball_contents\n directory.\n\n\nGet a post-patch version of the upstream sources for examination\n\n\nRun \nosg-build prepare \nPACKAGEDIR\n. Look inside the \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\nSee which patches work with a new version of a package, update or remove them\n\n\n\n\nPlace the new source tarball into the upstream cache, edit the version in the spec file and *.sources files as necessary\n\n\nRun \nosg-build quilt \nPACKAGEDIR\n.\n\n\nEnter the extracted sources inside the \n_final_srpm_contents\n directory. You should see a file called \nseries\n and a symlink called \npatches\n.\n\n\nType \nquilt series\n to get a list of patches in order of application.\n\n\nType \nquilt push\n to apply the next patch.\n\n\nIf the patch applies cleanly, continue.\n\n\nIf the patch applies with some fuzz, type \nquilt refresh\n to update the offsets in the patch.\n\n\nIf the patch does not apply and you wish to remove it, type \nquilt delete \nPATCH NAME\n (delete only removes it from the series file, not the disk)\n\n\nIf the patch does not apply and you wish to fix it, either type \nquilt push -f\n to interactively apply the patch, or \nquilt delete \nPATCH NAME\n the patch and use \nquilt new\n / \nquilt edit\n / \nquilt refresh\n to edit files and make a new patch from your changes. Consult the \nquilt(1)\n manpage for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a new patch, run \nquilt import \nPATCHFILE\n to add the patch to the series file, and run \nquilt push\n to apply it.\n\n\nIf you have changes to make to the source code that you want to save as a patch, type \nquilt new \nPATCHNAME\n, edit the files, type \nquilt add \nFILE\n on each file you edited, then type \nquilt refresh\n to recreate the patch.\n\n\nOnce you're all done, copy the patches in the \npatches/\n directory to the \nosg/\n dir in SVN, run \nquilt series\n to get the application order and update the spec file accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nSee if a package builds successfully for OSG 3.4\n\n\n\n\nIf you have all the build dependencies of the package installed, run \nosg-build rpmbuild \nPACKAGEDIR\n. The resulting RPMs will be in the \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\nIf you do not have all the build dependencies installed, or want to make sure you specified all of the necessary ones and the package builds from a clean environment, run \nosg-build mock --mock-config-from-koji osg-3.4-el6-build \nPACKAGEDIR\n. The resulting RPMs will be in the \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\nIf you do not have mock installed, or want to exactly replicate the build environment in Koji, run \nosg-build koji --scratch \nPACKAGEDIR\n. You may download the resulting RPMs from kojiweb \nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji\n or pass \n--getfiles\n to \nosg-build koji\n and they will get downloaded to the \n_build_results\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nCheck for potential errors in a package\n\n\nRun \nosg-build lint \nPACKAGEDIR\n.\n\n\nCreate and test a final build of a package for all platforms for upcoming\n\n\n\n\nsvn commit\n your changes in \nbranches/upcoming\n.\n\n\nType \nosg-build koji --repo=upcoming \nPACKAGEDIR\n\n\nWait for the \nosg-upcoming-minefield\n repos to be regenerated containing the new version of your package. You can run \nosg-koji wait-repo osg-upcoming-el\nX\n-development --build=\nPACKAGENAME-VERSION-RELEASE\n and wait for that process to finish (substitute \n6\n or \n7\n for \nX\n). Or, you can just check kojiweb \nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/tasks\n.\n\n\nOn your test machine, make sure the \nosg-upcoming-minefield\n repo is enabled (edit \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-upcoming-minefield.repo\n or \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6-upcoming-minefield.repo\n). Clean your cache (\nyum clean all; yum clean expire-cache\n).\n\n\nInstall your software, see if it works.\n\n\n\n\nPromote the latest build of a package to testing for the current OSG release series\n\n\nRun \nosg-promote -r testing \nPACKAGE\n\n\nPromote the latest build of a package to testing for the 3.3 and 3.4 release series\n\n\nRun \nosg-promote -r 3.3-testing -r 3.4-testing \nPACKAGE",

It is meant primarily for OSG Software team members who need to interact with the service.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nUsing and understanding the following terminology correctly will help in the reading of this document:\n\n\nPackage\n\nThis refers to a named piece of software in the Koji database. An example would be \"lcmaps\".\n\n\nBuild\n\nA specific version and release of a package, and an associated state. A build state may be successful (and contain RPMs), failed, or in-progress. A given build may be in one or more tags. The build is associated with the output of the latest build task with the same version and release of the package.\n\n\nTag\n\nA named set of packages and builds, parent tags, and reference to external repositories. An example would be the \"osg-3.3-el6-development\" tag, which contains (among others) the \"lcmaps\" package and the \"lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6\" build. There is an inheritance structure to tags: by default, all packages/builds in a parent tag are added to the tag. A tag may contain a reference to (possibly inherited) external repositories; the RPMs in these repositories are added to repositories created from this tag. Examples of referenced external repositories include CentOS base, EPEL, or JPackage.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA tag is NOT a yum repository.\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\nA target consists of a build tag and a destination tag. An example is \"osg-3.3-el6\", where the build tag is \"osg-3.3-el6-build\" and the destination tag is \"osg-3.3-el6\". A target is used by the build task to know what repository to build from and tag to build into.\n\n\nTask\n\nA unit of work for Koji. Several common tasks are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild\n\n    This task takes a SRPM and a target, and attempts to create a complete Build in the target's destination tag from the target's build repository. This task will launch one buildArch task for each architecture in the destination tag; if each subtask is successful, then it will launch a tagBuild subtask.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the build task is marked as \"scratch\", then it won't result in a saved Build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuildArch\n\n    This task takes a SRPM, architecture name, and a Koji repository as an input, and runs \nmock\n to create output RPMs for that arch. The build artifacts are added to the Build if all buildArch tasks are successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntagBuild\n\n    This adds a successful build to a given tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewRepo\n\n    This creates a new repository from a given tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild artifacts\n\nThe results of a buildArch task. Their metadata are recorded in the Koji database, and files are saved to disk. Metadata may include checksums, timestamps, and who initiated the task. Artifacts may include RPMs, SRPMs, and build logs.\n\n\nRepository\n\nA yum repository created from the contents of a tag at a specific point in time. By default, the yum repository will contain all successful, non-blocked builds in the tag, plus all RPMs in the external repositories for the tag.\n\n\nUsing Koji\n\n\nRequired Software\n\n\nUsing Koji requires:\n\n\n\n\nosg-build\n version 1.6.3 or later.\n\n\nkoji\n 1.6.0-2.osg or later. \nNote\n that you want a koji build from osg; the output of \nrpm -q koji\n should end in \".osg\".\n\n\n\n\nBoth pieces of software are available from the osg repositories. \nosg-build\n may also be obtained from GitHub by cloning out \nhttps://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build\n\n\nSpecial instructions for UW-Madison CSL machines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone the osg-build GitHub repo:\n\n\n[you@host]$\n git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd this directory to your \n$PATH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-koji setup\n\n\n\n\n\nto set up the koji configuration and certificates in \n~/.osg-koji\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining a login\n\n\nYou will be using your grid certificate to log in. Email a Koji admin the DN of your certificate, and we will set up a Koji account with the appropriate permissions.\n\n\nIf you are switching certificate providers, you will need to email a Koji admin with your new DN. You will also need to clear your browser cookies and cache for \nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org\n before trying to use the Koji web interface again. If your CN has changed, you will not be able to use your old certificate.\n\n\nCurrent Koji admins are Mat Selmeci and Carl Edquist.\n\n\nConfiguring certificate authentication\n\n\nYou must also configure certificate authentication for the command-line tools on your build host:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-koji setup\n\n\n\n\n\nto set up the appropriate configuration and certificates in \n~/.osg-koji\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, you will also be able to run koji commands manually by using the \nosg-koji\n wrapper script. You might need to rerun \nosg-koji setup\n if you renew or change your cert.\n\n\nCreating a new build\n\n\nWe create a new build in Koji from the package's directory in OSG Software subversion.\n\n\nIf a successful build already exists in Koji (regardless of whether it is in the tag you use), you cannot replace the build. Two builds are the same if they have the same NVR (Name-Version-Release). You \ncan\n do a \"scratch\" build, which recompiles, but the results are not added to the tag. This is useful for experimenting with koji.\n\n\nTo do a build, execute the following command from within the OSG Software subversion checkout:\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-build koji \nPACKAGE NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do a scratch build, simply add the \n--scratch\n command line flag.\n\n\nEach invocation of osg-build will ask for the password once or twice; if you get asked more like 20 times, then you may not be running the OSG-patched version of Koji; try switching to the one from the osg-development repository.\n\n\nWhen you do a non-scratch build, it will build with the \nosg-el6\n and \nosg-el7\n targets. This will assign your build the \nosg-3.4-el6-development\n and \nosg-3.4-el7-development\n tags (and your package will be assigned the \nosg-el6\n and \nosg-el7\n tags). If successful, your build will end up in the Koji \nosg-minefield\n yum repos and will eventually show up in the \nosg-development\n yum repos. This is a high latency process.\n\n\nBuild task Results\n\n\nHow to find build results\n\n\nThe most recent build results are always shown on the home page of Koji:\n\n\nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/index\n\n\nClicking on a build result brings you to the build information page. A successful build will result in the build page having build logs, RPMs, and a SRPM.\n\n\nIf your build isn't in the recent list, you can use the search box in the upper-right-hand corner. Type the exact package name (or use a wildcard), and it will bring up a list of all builds for that package. You can find your build from there. For example, the \"lcmaps\" package page is here:\n\n\nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=56\n\n\nAnd the lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6 build is here:\n\n\nhttps://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=7427\n\n\nTrying our your build\n\n\nBecause it takes a while for your build to get into one of the regular repositories, it's simplest to download your RPM directly (see the previous section on How to find build results), and install it with:\n\n\n[root@host]#\n yum localinstall \nRPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the resulting RPM into a repository\n\n\nOnce a package has been built, it is added to a tag. We then must turn the tag into a yum repository. This is normally done automatically and you do not need to deal with it yourself. Three notes:\n\n\n\n\nThe kojira daemon creates a repository automatically post-build on the koji-hub host. Eventually, the development repository will be the one hosted by koji-hub.\n\n\n\n\nThe koji-hub repository can be created manually by running\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-koji regen-repo \nTAG NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the tag name for osg-development in 3.4 on el6 is \"osg-3.4-el6-development\". Likely, you won't need to do this when kojira is working.\n-   Repositories are created on external hosts with the \nmash\n tool. These are usually triggered by cron jobs, but may be run by hand too. Documentation for running mash is on the TODO list.\n-   You can create your own personal repository using \nmash\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging build issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailed build tasks can be seen from the Koji homepage. The logs from the tasks are included. Relevant logs include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroot.log\n\n    This is the log of mock trying to create an appropriate build root for your RPM. This will invoke yum twice: once to create a generic build root, once for all the dependencies in your BuildRequires. All RPMs in your build root will be logged here. If mock is unable to create the build root, the reason will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n404 Errors\n\n\nIf you see \nError downloading packages\n and \nHTTP Error 404 - Not Found\n errors in your \nroot.log\n,\nthis commonly indicates that an rpm repo mirror was updated and our build repo is out-of-date.\nThis can be fixed by regenerating the relevant build repos for your builds.\n\n\nThis is usually something like \nosg-3.4-el7-build\n or \nosg-upcoming-el7-build\n;\nbut you can find the exact build tag by clicking the Build Target link for the koji task,\nand whatever is listed for the Build Tag is the name of the repo to regen.\n\n\nRegenerate each repo that failed with 404 errors:\n\n\n$\n osg-koji regen-repo \nBUILD TAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild.log\n\n    The output of the rpmbuild executable. If your package fails to compile, the reason will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne input to the buildArch task is a repository, which is based on a Koji tag. If the repository hasn't been recreated for a dependency you need (for example, when kojira isn't working), you may not have the right RPMs available in your build root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne common issue is building a chain of dependencies. For example, suppose build B depends on the results of build A. If you build A then build B immediately, B will likely fail. This is because A is not in the repository that B uses. The proper string of events building A, starting the regeneration of the destination and build repo (which should happen in a few minutes of the build A task completing), then submitting build task B.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nif you submit build task B while the build repository task is open, it will not start until the build task has finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther errors\n\n\n\n\npackage \nPACKAGE NAME\n not in list for tag \nTAG\n\n    This happens when the name of the directory your package is in does not match the name of the package.\n    You must rename one or the other and commit your changes before trying again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromoting Builds from Development -\n Testing\n\n\nSoftware contributors can promote any package to testing. Members of the security team can promote ca-cert packages to testing.\n\n\nTo promote from development to testing:\n\n\nUsing \nosg-promote\n\n\nIf you want to promote the latest version:\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-promote -r \nOSGVER\n-testing \nPACKAGE NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPACKAGE NAME\n is the bare package name without version, e.g. \ngratia-probe\n.\n\n\nIf you want to promote a specific version:\n\n\n[you@host]$\n osg-promote -r \nOSGVER\n-testing \nBUILD NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUILD NAME\n is a full \nname-version-revision.disttag\n such as \ngratia-probe-1.17.0-2.osg33.el6\n.\n\n\nOSGVER\n is the OSG major version that you are promoting for (e.g. \n3.4\n).\n\n\nosg-promote\n will promote both the el6 and el7 builds of a package. After promoting, copy and paste the JIRA code \nosg-promote\n produces into the JIRA ticket that you are working on.\n\n\nFor \nosg-promote\n, you may omit the \n.osg34.el6\n or \n.osg34.el7\n; the script will add the appropriate disttag on.\n\n\nSee \nOSG Building Tools\n for full details on \nosg-promote\n.\n\n\nCreating custom koji areas\n\n\nOccasionally you may want to make builds of a package (or packages) which you\ndo not yet want to go into the main development repos.  In this case, you can\ncreate a set of custom koji tags and build targets for these builds.  We have\na script in our\n\nosg-next-tools\n repo\ncalled\n\nnew-koji-area\n\nthat facilitates this set up.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Koji documentation: \nhttps://docs.pagure.org/koji/\n\n\nFedora's koji documentation: \nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji\n\n\nFedora's \"Using Koji\" page: \nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_the_Koji_build_system\n Note that some instructions there may not apply to OSG's Koji.

This will invoke yum twice: once to create a generic build root, once for all the dependencies in your BuildRequires. All RPMs in your build root will be logged here. If mock is unable to create the build root, the reason will show up here.    404 Errors  If you see  Error downloading packages  and  HTTP Error 404 - Not Found  errors in your  root.log ,\nthis commonly indicates that an rpm repo mirror was updated and our build repo is out-of-date.\nThis can be fixed by regenerating the relevant build repos for your builds.  This is usually something like  osg-3.4-el7-build  or  osg-upcoming-el7-build ;\nbut you can find the exact build tag by clicking the Build Target link for the koji task,\nand whatever is listed for the Build Tag is the name of the repo to regen.  Regenerate each repo that failed with 404 errors:  $  osg-koji regen-repo  BUILD TAG       build.log \n    The output of the rpmbuild executable. If your package fails to compile, the reason will show up here.      One input to the buildArch task is a repository, which is based on a Koji tag. If the repository hasn't been recreated for a dependency you need (for example, when kojira isn't working), you may not have the right RPMs available in your build root.    One common issue is building a chain of dependencies. For example, suppose build B depends on the results of build A. If you build A then build B immediately, B will likely fail. This is because A is not in the repository that B uses. The proper string of events building A, starting the regeneration of the destination and build repo (which should happen in a few minutes of the build A task completing), then submitting build task B.   Note  if you submit build task B while the build repository task is open, it will not start until the build task has finished.

            "text": "Mass RPM Rebuilds for a new Build Target in Koji\n\n\nWhenever we move to a new OSG series (OSG 3.3) and/or a new RHEL version (EL7), we want to make new builds for all of our packages in the new koji build target (osg-3.3-el7). Due to tricky build dependencies and unexpected build failures, this can be a messy task; and in the past we have gone about it in an ad-hoc manner.\n\n\nThis document will discuss some of the aspects of the task and issues involved, some possible approaches, and ultimately a proposal for a general tool or procedure for doing our mass rebuilds.\n\n\nNew RHEL version vs new OSG series\n\n\nNew RHEL version\n\n\nFor a new RHEL version, we start with no osg packages to build against, so we are forced to build things in dependency order. Figuring out the dependency order is possibly the most difficult (or interesting) part of doing mass rebuilds -- more on that later.\n\n\nNew OSG series\n\n\nFor a new OSG series within an existing RHEL version, we have more options. While it's possible to \"start from scratch\" the same way we would with a new RHEL version and build everything in dependency order, this is not really necessary if we take advantage of existing builds from the previous series.\n\n\nA prior step is to determine the package list for the new series -- this will be some combination of Upcoming and the current release series, minus any packages pruned for the new series. This should also be reflected in the new trunk packaging area. All the current builds for packages in that list (from upcoming + current series) can be tagged into the new *-development (or *-build) repos. This should make all of the build dependencies available for mass rebuilding the new series all at once (osg-build koji *).\n\n\nAfter some consideration, I wholeheartedly endorse this approach for new OSG series -- for all but academic exercises. Rebuilding in dependency order when all the dependencies are already built just seems like wasted effort.\n\n\nDoing scratch builds of everything first\n\n\nBefore doing the mass rebuilds in a new build target, it seems to be a good idea to do scratch builds of all the packages in the current series first. (Or, at least the ones we intend to bring into the new build target.) This will give us a chance to see any build failures that have crept in (possibly due to upstream changes in the OS or EPEL), and fix them first if desired, but in any case avoid the confusion of seeing the failures for the first time in the new build target.\n\n\nDoing mass scratch rebuilds for an existing series is easy, as they can all be done at once.\n\n\nRelatedly, doing a round of scratch builds \nafter\n successfully building all packages into a new build target can also be useful, because it can reveal dependency issues only present in the new set of builds. Doing developer test installs or a round of VMU tests may also uncover any runtime dependency issues.\n\n\nOptions for calculating build dependencies\n\n\nWe can get dependency information from a number of places:\n\n\n\n\nscraping .spec files for Requires/BuildRequires/Provides and \n%package\n names\n\n\nquerying existing rpms directly on koji-hub and our OS/EPEL mirrors (\nrpm -q\n)\n\n\nquerying srpms from \nosg-build prebuild\n directly for build requirements\n\n\ninspecting previous buildroots to determine resolved build dependencies\n\n\nuse \nrepoquery\n to determine whatrequires/whatprovides for packages\n\n\nuse \nyum-builddep\n to find packages with all build requirements available\n\n\nusing the repodata (primary+filelists) from rpm repositories, including:\n\n\nupcoming + 3.X development + external repos (Centos/EPEL/JPackage), OR\n\n\nosg-upcoming-elX-build, which includes them all\n\n\n\n\nOne important aspect is that the runtime requirements are also relevant for determining build requirements, since a build will require installing all of the runtime requirements of the packages required for the build.\n\n\nThat is, \n(A BuildRequires B) and (B Requires C)\n implies \nA BuildRequires C\n.\n\n\nCombined with the fact that runtime requirements are transitive, that is, \n(A Requires B) and (B Requires C)\n implies \nA Requires C\n, computing build requirements is a recursive operation, which can be many levels deep.\n\n\nAnother question to keep in mind is whether to use versioned requires/provides (i.e., BuildRequires xyz \n= 1.2-3) or to only pay attention to the package/capability names. Similarly, whether to pay any attention to conflicts/obsoletes. These would add complexity to anything except the standard tools (repoquery, yum-builddep) which already take these things into account. (And we may get pretty far even without paying attention to versions.)\n\n\nNote also that the dependencies/capabilities for a given package often varies between different rhel versions.\n\n\nPre-computing (predictive) vs just-in-time\n\n\nTwo different approaches to determining dependency order for building are:\n\n\n\n\npre compute all dependencies based on an existing series/rhel version, OR\n\n\ncompute which remaining packages have all build reqs satisfied now\n\n\n\n\nThe first approach has the benefit of being able to determine the packages that need to be built in order to accomplish a smaller subset goal first -- for example, to be able to install osg-wn-client. (And, if there are problems with resolving certain dependencies (say with osg-wn-client again), it will become apparent earlier, as opposed to not until all possible-to-build packages have been built.) The limitation of this approach is that the predicted set of files/capabilities that a binary package will provide may differ between osg series/rhel versions, and as a result may be inaccurate for the new build target.\n\n\nThe second approach provides somewhat more confidence about being able to correctly determine which packages should be buildable at any point in time, but (as mentioned above) it is a bit more in the dark about seeing the bigger picture of the dependency graph or being able to build subsets of targets.\n\n\nIt may be useful to have both options available -- building from the list in the second approach, but using the first mechanism to have a better picture of where things are at, or perhaps to steer toward finishing a certain subset of packages first.\n\n\nPackage list closure, pruning\n\n\nAt some point (either in the planning stage or after building packages into the new build target), we need to ensure that the new osg series/rhel version contains all of its install requirements for all of its packages. It would probably suffice to do a VMU run that installs each package (perhaps individually, to avoid conflicts).\n\n\nBut if we go about it more analytically, we may also get, as a result, a list of packages which we previously only maintained for the purpose of building our other packages (ie, that were never required at runtime for any use cases that we cared about), which now, in the new target, are no longer build requirements (directly or indirectly) for any packages that we care about installing. Packages in this category could be reviewed to also be dropped from the new build target.\n\n\nProposal / Recommendations\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, my recommendation is that we treat a new OSG series differently than a new RHEL version.\n\n\nFor a new OSG series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate native/redhat packaging area to reflect packages for new series, including upcoming + trunk - removed packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntag existing builds of packages in new list into the new development tag (eg, for osg-3.3-el6, tag the .osgup.el6 and .osg32.el6 builds into osg-3.3-el6-development)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild all packages in new packaging area into new build target at once\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor all successful builds, remove corresponding old builds (eg, .osgup/.osg32) from the new tag (osg-3.3-el6-development)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a new RHEL version:\n\n\n\n\npull the repodata from the relevant \n*-build\n repo from koji:\n\n\n\n\nfor pre-computing, use a build repo from an existing rhel version:\n\n\nhttps://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el6-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/\n\n\nfor just-in-time, use the new build repo:\n\n\nhttps://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el8-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/\n\n\nthe primary and filelists (sqlite) files can be used to get runtime requires and provides. (Note that this includes packages from the relevant external repos, also.)\n\n\n\n\ngenerate srpms repodata for the current set of packages to build, with osg-build prebuild and createrepo.\n\n\n\n\nthe primary (sqlite) file can be used to get build-requires.\n\n\n\n\nuse sql to resolve direct dependencies at the package name level:\n\n\nsrc-pkg: bin-pkg (BuildRequires)\n\n\nbin-pkg: bin-pkg (Requires)\n\n\nbin-pkg: src-pkg (bin-pkg comes from which src-pkg? only needed for pre-computing dependencies)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresolve this list into a full list of recursive build dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nSince this is recursive, there is no way to do it in a fixed number of sql queries. However the above input list is already directly consumable by Make, which is designed to handle recursive dependencies just like this. Or we can write a new tool to do it in python.\n\n\n\n\nbuild ready-to-be-built packages\n\n\nupdate our copy of the repodata from the regen'ed \n*-build\n repo, as often as new versions become available\n\n\nupdate our dependency lists\n\n\nrepeat until all packages are built",

packages for multiple OSG release series\n\n\nThe OSG Software team supports multiple release series, independent but in parallel to a large degree.\nIn many cases, a single package is the same across release series, and therefore we want to build the package once\nand share it among the series.\nThe procedure below suggests a way to accomplish this task.\n\n\nCurrent definitions:\n\n\n\n\nmaintenance: OSG 3.4 ( \ntrunk\n )\n\n\ncurrent: OSG 3.5 ( \nbranches/osg-3.5\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n\n\nMake changes to \ntrunk\n\n\nOptionally, make and test a scratch build from \ntrunk\n\n\nCommit the changes\n\n\nMake an official build from \ntrunk\n (e.g.: \nosg-build koji \nPACKAGE\n)\n\n\nPerform the standard 4 tests for the \ncurrent\n series (see below)\n\n\nMerge the relevant commits from \ntrunk\n into the \nmaintenance\n branch (see below for tips)\n\n\nOptionally, make and test a scratch build from the \nmaintenance\n branch\n\n\nCommit the merge\n\n\nMake an official build from the \nmaintenance\n branch (e.g.: \nosg-build koji --repo=3.4 \nPACKAGE\n)\n\n\nPerform the standard 4 tests for the \nmaintenance\n series (see below)\n\n\nAs needed (or directed by the Software manager), perform the cross-series tests (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDo not change the RPM Release number in the \nmaintenance\n branch before rebuilding;\nthe \n%dist\n tag will differ automatically, and hence the \nmaintenance\n and \ncurrent\n NVRs will not conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging changes from one release series to another\n\n\nThese instructions assume that you are merging from \ntrunk\n to \nbranches/osg-3.5\n.\nThey also assume that the current directory you are in is a checkout of \nbranches/osg-3.5\n.\nI will use \n$pkg\n to refer to the name of your package.\n\n\nFirst, you will need the commit numbers for your changes:\n\n\nsvn log \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg | less\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the commits you want to merge.\n\n\nIf you only have one commit, merge that commit with -c as follows:\n\n\nsvn merge -c $commit_num \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n$commit_num\n is the SVN revision number of that commit (e.g. 17000).\nMerging an individual change like this is referred to as \"cherry-picking\".\n\n\nIf you have a range of commits and you wish to merge all commits within that range, then do the following:\n\n\nsvn merge -r $start_num:$end_num \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n$start_num\n is the SVN revision of the commit \nBEFORE\n your first commit,\nand \n$end_num\n is the SVN revision of your last commit in that range.\n\nNote:\n Be very careful when merging a range from trunk into the maintenance branch\nso that you do not introduce more changes to the maintenance branch than are necessary.\n\n\nIf you have multiple commits but they are not contiguous (i.e. there are commits made by you or someone else in that range\nthat you do not want to merge), you will need to cherry-pick each individual commit.\n\n\nsvn merge -c $commit1 \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg\nsvn merge -c $commit2 \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n$commit1\n, \n$commit2\n are the commit numbers of the individual changes.\n\n\nNote that merge tracking in recent versions of SVN (1.5 or newer) should prevent commits from accidentally being merged multiple times.\nYou should still look out for conflicts and examine the changes via \nsvn diff\n before committing the merge.\n\n\nTesting Procedures\n\n\nBefore promoting a package to a testing repository, each build must be tested lightly from the development repos\nto make sure that it is not completely broken, thereby wasting time during acceptance testing.\nNormally, the person who builds a package performs the development testing.\n\n\nIf you are not doing your own development testing for a package\n, contact the Software Manager\nand/or leave a comment in the associated ticket; otherwise, your package may never be promoted to testing and hence never released.\n\n\nThe \"Standard 4\" tests, defined\n\n\nIn most cases, the Software manager will ask a developer to perform the \u201cstandard 4\u201d tests\non an updated package in a release series before promotion.\nThis is a shorthand description for a standard set of 4 test runs:\n\n\n\n\nFresh install on el6\n\n\nFresh install on el7\n\n\nUpdate install on el6\n\n\nUpdate install on el7\n\n\n\n\nAn \u201cupdate install\u201d is a fresh install of the relevant package (or better yet, metapackage that includes it)\n\nfrom the production repository\n, followed by an update to the new build \nfrom the development repository\n.\n\n\nFor each test run, the amount of functional testing required will vary.\n\n\n\n\nFor very simple changes, it may be sufficient to verify that each installation succeeds and that the expected files are in place\n\n\nFor some changes, it may be sufficient to run osg-test on the resulting installation\n\n\nFor some changes, it will be necessary to perform careful functional tests of the affected component(s)\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions, check with the Software Manager to determine the amount of testing that is required per test run.\n\n\nThe \"Cross-Series\" test, defined\n\n\nThe cross-series test may need to be run for packages that have been built for multiple release series of the OSG software stack (i.e. 3.4 and 3.5):\n\n\n\n\nOn el7, install from the 3.4 repositories, then update from the 3.5 repositories\n\n\n\n\nViewed another way, this test is similar to the update installs, above, except from 3.4-release to 3.5-development.\n\n\nThe \"Long Tail\" tests, defined\n\n\nThese tests may need to be run when updating a package that's also in the old, unsupported (3.3) branch. They will consist of:\n\n\n\n\nInstall from 3.3-release and update to 3.5-development (on el7 only)\n\n\n\n\nThe \"full set of tests\", defined\n\n\nAll of the tests mentioned above.\n\n\nRunning the tests in VM Universe\n\n\nIn the case that the package you're testing is covered by osg-tested-internal,\nyou can run the full set of tests in a manual VM universe test run.\nMake sure you meet the \npre-requisites\n required\nto submit VM Universe jobs on \nosghost.chtc.wisc.edu\n.\nAfter that's done, prepare the test suite with a comment describing the test run.\nFor example, if you were testing a new \nhtcondor-ce\n package:\n\n\nosg-run-tests \nTesting htcondor-ce-3.2.1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you \ncd\n into the directory specified in the output of the previous command,\nyou will need to edit the \n*.yaml\n files in \nparameters.d\n to reflect the tests that you will want to run,\ni.e. clean installs, upgrade installs and upgrade installs between OSG versions.\n\n\nOnce you're satisfied with your list of parameters, submit the dag:\n\n\ncondor_submit_dag master-run.dag\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromoting a Package to Testing\n\n\nOnce development and development testing is complete, the final OSG Software step is to promote the package(s)\nto our testing repositories.\nAfter that, the Release team takes over with acceptance testing and ultimately release.\nOf course if they discover problems, the ticket(s) will be returned to OSG Software for further development,\nessentially restarting the development cycle.\n\n\nPreparing a Good Promotion Request\n\n\nDevelopers must obtain permission from the OSG Software manager to promote a package from development to testing.\nA promotion request goes into at least one affected JIRA ticket and will be answered there as well.\nBelow are some tips for writing a good promotion request:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that relevant information about goals, history, and resolution is in the associated ticket(s)\n\n\nInclude globs for the NVRs to be promoted (or a detailed list, if it is that complicated, which it almost never is)\n\n\nIf you ran automated tests:\n\n\nLink to the results page(s)\n\n\nVerify that relevant tests ran successfully (as opposed to being skipped or failing) \u2013\u00a0briefly summarize your findings\n\n\nNote whether the automated tests are just regression tests or actually test the current change(s)\n\n\nIf there are \nany\n failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ran manual tests:\n\n\nSummarize your tests and findings\n\n\nIf there were failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are critical build dependencies that we typically check, include reports from the \nbuilt-against-pkgs\n tool\n\n\nNote: This step is really just for known, specific cases, like the {HTCondor, HTCondor-CE, BLAHP} set and the {BeStMan, GUMS, VOMS Admin, etc.} Java set\n\n\nOccasionally, the OSG Software manager will request the tool to be run for other cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf other packages depend on the to-be-promoted package, explain whether the dependent packages must be rebuilt or, if not, why not\n\n\n\n\nFor example (hypothetical promotion request for HTCondor-CE):\n\n\n\n\nMay I promote \nhtcondor-ce-2.3.4-2.osg3*.el*\n? I ran a complete set of automated tests \nLINK THE PRECEDING TEXT OR SEPARATELY HERE>;\nthe HTCondor-CE tests ran and passed in all cases. There were some spurious failures of RSV in the All condition for RHEL 6,\nbut this is a known failure case that is independent of HTCondor-CE. I also did a few spot checks manually\n(one VM each for SL 6 and SL 7), and in each case setting \nuse_frobnosticator = true\n in the configuration resulted in\nthe expected behavior as defined in the description field above.\nThe \nbuilt-against-pkgs\n tool shows that I built against all the latest HTCondor and BLAHP builds, see below.\n\nJIRA-formatted table comes after>\n\n\n\n\nPromoting\n\n\nFollow these steps to request promotion, promote a package, and note the promotion in JIRA:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the package update has at least one associated JIRA ticket;\n    if there is no ticket, at least create one for releasing the package(s)\n\n\nObtain permission to promote the package(s) from the Software Manager (see above)\n\n\nUse \nosg-promote\n to promote the package(s) from development to testing\n\n\nComment on the associated JIRA ticket(s) with osg-promote's JIRA-formatted output (or at least the build NVRs) and,\n    if you know, suggestions for acceptance testing\n\n\nMark each associated JIRA ticket as \u201cReady For Testing\u201d",

It is intended for people who wish to contribute to OSG software.\n\n\nGit and GitHub basics\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, the GitHub website has a good series of tutorials at \nhttps://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/\n\n\nGetting shell access to GitHub\n\n\nThere are multiple ways of authenticating to GitHub from the shell. This section will cover using SSH keys. This is no longer the method recommended by GitHub, but is easier to set up for someone with existing SSH experience.\n\n\nThe instructions here are derived from \nGitHub's own instructions on using SSH keys\n.\n\n\nCreating a new SSH key (optional but recommended)\n\n\nIf you already have an SSH keypair in your \n~/.ssh\n directory that you want to use for GitHub, you may skip this step. It is more secure, however, to create a new keypair specifically for use with GitHub.\n\n\nThe instructions below will create an SSH public/private key pair with the private key stored in \n~/.ssh/id_github\n and public key stored in \n~/.ssh/id_github.pub\n.\n\n\nGenerating the key\n\n\nUse \nssh-keygen\n to generate the SSH keypair. For \nEMAIL_ADDRESS\n, use the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n ssh-keygen -t rsa -b \n4096\n -f ~/.ssh/id_github -C \nEMAIL_ADDRESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring SSH to use the key for GitHub\n\n\nMake sure SSH uses the new key by default to access GitHub. Create or edit \n~/.ssh/config\n and append the following lines:\n\n\nHost github.com\n\nIdentityFile \nYOUR_HOME_DIR\n/.ssh/id_github\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n is the output of the command:\n\necho $HOME\n\n\nAdding the SSH public key to GitHub\n\n\nUsing the GitHub web interface:\n\n\n\n\nOn the upper right of the screen, click on your profile picture\n\n\nIn the menu that pops up, click \"Settings\"\n\n\nOn the left-hand sidebar, click \"SSH and GPG keys\"\n\n\nIn the top right of the \"SSH keys\" box, click \"New SSH key\"\n\n\nIn the \"Title\" field of the dialog that pops up, enter a descriptive name for the key\n\n\nOpen the public key file (e.g. \n~/.ssh/id_github.pub\n (don't forget the \n.pub\n)) in a text editor and copy its full contents to the clipboard\n\n\nIn the \"Key\" field, paste the public key\n\n\nBelow the \"Key\" field, click \"Add SSH key\"\n\n\n\n\nYou should see your new key in the \"SSH keys\" list.\n\n\nTesting that shell access works\n\n\nTo verify you can authenticate to GitHub using SSH, SSH to \ngit@github.com\n. You should see a message that 'you've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.'\n\n\nContribution workflow\n\n\nWe use the standard GitHub \npull request\n workflow for making contributions to OSG software.\n\n\nIf you've never contributed to this project on GitHub before, do the following steps first:\n\n\n\n\nUsing the GitHub web interface, fork the repo you wish to contribute to.\n\n\n\n\nMake a clone of your forked repo on your local machine.\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git clone git@github.com:\nUSERNAME/PROJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nUSERNAME\n is your github username and \nPROJECT\n is the name of the project you want to contribute to,\ne.g. in order to clone my local fork of the \nopenscience/technology\n repository: \n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git clone https://github.com/ddavila0/technology.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you get a \"Permission denied\" error, your public key may not be set up with GitHub -- please see the \"Getting shell access to GitHub\" section above.\n\n\nIf you get some other error, \nthe GitHub page on SSH\n may contain useful information on troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have your local repo, do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch to hold changes that are related to the issue you are working on. Give the \nBRANCH\n a name that will remind you of its purpose, such as \nsw2345-pathchange\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git checkout -b \nBRANCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake your commits to this branch, then push the branch to your repo on GitHub.\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git push origin \nBRANCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect your branch in the GitHub web interface, then create a \"pull request\" against the original repo. Add a good description of your change into the message for the pull request. Enter a JIRA ticket number in the message to automatically link the pull request to the JIRA ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest a review from the drop down menu on the right and wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a software team member.\n\n\n\n\nIf the team member accepts your changes, they will merge your pull request, and your changes will be incorporated upstream. You may then delete the branch you created your pull request from.\n\n\nIf your changes are rejected, then you may make additional changes to the branch that your pull request is for. Once you push the changes from your local repo to your GitHub repo, they will automatically be added to the pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease workflow\n\n\nThis section is intended for OSG Software team members or the primary developers of a software project (i.e. those that make releases). Some of the steps require direct write access the GitHub repo for the project owned by \nopensciencegrid\n. (If you can approve pull requests, you have write access).\n\n\nA release of a software is created from your local clone of a software project. Before you release, you need to make sure your local clone is in sync with the GitHub repo owned by \nopensciencegrid\n (the OSG repo):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't already, add the OSG repo as a \"remote\" to your repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git remote add upstream git@github.com:opensciencegrid/\nPROJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nPROJECT\n is the name of the project you are going to release, e.g. \n for \nopenscience/technology\n repository it would be \ntechnology.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch changes from the OSG repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git fetch upstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare your branch you are releasing from (probably \nmaster\n) to its copy in the OSG repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git checkout master\n;\n git diff upstream/master\n\n\n\n\n\nThere should be no differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, release the software as you usually do. This process varies from one project to another, but often it involves running \nmake upstream\n or similar. Check your project's \nREADME\n file for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nTest your software.\n\n\n\n\nTag the commit that you made the release from. Git release tags are conventionally called \nVERSION\n, where \nVERSION\n is the version of the software you are releasing. So if you're releasing version 1.3.0, you would create the \nTAG\n \nv1.3.0\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnce a tag has been pushed to the OSG repo, it should not be changed. Be sure the commit you want to tag is the final one you made the release from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the tag in your local repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git tag \nTAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush the tag to your own GitHub repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git push origin \nTAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush the tag to the OSG repo:\n\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git push upstream \nTAG",

The focus is on having reasonably accurate, unbiased data. We might use the data later, for example, to hone future OSG proposals. And of course, all federal funding is subject to effort tracking.\n\n\nThere are just a few simple ideas to keep in mind:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach week, report your effort on OSG Technology activities\n\n\nUpdate your numbers in the effort tracking google spreadsheet (ask BrianL for access) and include a section in your weekly status report; here is an example:\n\n\nEFFORT\nExternal development: 63% \nSupport: 12% \nLeave: 20% \nOutside: 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow standard federal regulations for calculating effort\n (e.g., OMB Circular A-21)\n\n\nThe main idea is that \nall\n of your job-related activity for a week equals 100%, whether that is exactly 40 hours of work, a little less (subject to your local institution\u2019s rules), or more. This implies that the same hours worked could result in different effort percentages reported from week to week; for example, 4 hours in a 40-hour week is 10%, but 4 hours in a 50-hour week (which I hope is exceedingly rare) is 8%.\n\n\nReport 100% of your effort each week, but note that all effort outside of the Technology area falls into a single category. Unless you work at UW\u2013Madison, we do not need to know any details about your effort outside of the Technology area. (BrianL will talk to UW\u2013Madison folks about local expectations.)\n\n\nIf you are assigned to the Technology area for less than 100%, please report your actual Technology effort accurately. Workloads vary from week to week. For example, suppose you are 50% Technology in general, but you actually work 24 hours in a 40-hour week; you should report 60% effort for that week. The goal is to present reality, not what you think management wants to see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffort is reported as \ninteger\n percentages, no less accurate than 5% intervals\n \n     So please do not report percentages like 43.21% and please do not round to the nearest 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffort Categories\n\n\nHere are the categories in which to track effort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\n\n\nWork on the Investigations team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal\n\n\nSoftware work that (generally) benefits our users; e.g., creating packages; updating existing ones; designing, coding, and testing new tools, existing tools, patches, or our software components\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal\n\n\nSoftware work on tools that we use to get work done; e.g., working on osg-test (for now), osg-build, Koji maintenance, the UW or UC ITB instances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nWork on our TWiki or Markdown documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nRelease team activities, primarily acceptance testing and cutting releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nUser support, including working on GOC tickets, direct support emails, some JIRA tickets that are more support than development, etc. It might be tricky to decide when support work becomes development work; generally, once a support ticket turns into a JIRA ticket and goes through the normal development lifecycle, then the JIRA-based work is development. If there is still extensive communication with GOC ticket users, that is still support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement\n\n\nThis is mainly for team leads; e.g., managing team activities and tickets (generally); hiring; \nleading\n (not just attending) meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nNot for general learning or training activities\n The OSG Education area is essentially part of the Software area, because many technology-area members contribute to the OSG School. So this category is for OSG School effort (or other sanctioned OSG Education activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\nGeneral administrative activities that benefit the OSG Technology area but that do not fit elsewhere \u2014 \nuse sparingly!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside\n\n\nFor all activities outside of the OSG Technology area (Madison team members should provide extra details, see BrianL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave\n\n\nThis is for holidays, vacation, and sick leave; count a full day of leave as 8.0 hours, count a half day as 4.0 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few thoughts about tricky situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeetings. If a meeting is specific to one of the categories above, use that category. If the meeting is more general (e.g., the weekly Monday meeting, or the OSG AHM), amortize your time according to your usual breakdown by category. For example, someone who spends nearly all of their time working on development tasks should count the Monday meeting as development time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative activities. This is probably the trickiest category. It certainly covers any administrative work that pertains to your activity in the OSG Technology area. But what about administrative activities that pertain to your employment in general, and not to any particular activity? In that case, and that case only, you should amortize the administrative activity between \nAdmin\n and \nOutside\n according to either (a) your appointment percentages between OSG Technology and non-Technology activities, or (b) your actual percentages between OSG Technology and non-Technology activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside (non-Technology) activities that benefit the OSG Technology area. The simplest approach is to amortize the time. The more correct approach is to figure out where credit will be given for the work; if the OSG Annual Report will describe the work in one of the Technology sections, then it should be a Technology category; otherwise not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning activities. Put short amounts of learning time in their relevant development category. For instance, if Igor is showing Edgar how to use GlideTester, that goes into \nInternal\n. But for longer training events, or for events that are less obviously related to day-to-day activities, mark the time as \nAdmin\n, and maybe add a comment explaining the activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, if you are not sure how to deal with a situation, ask BrianL and he will make something up and document it here (generically) for future reference.",

Management  This is mainly for team leads; e.g., managing team activities and tickets (generally); hiring;  leading  (not just attending) meetings    Education  Not for general learning or training activities  The OSG Education area is essentially part of the Software area, because many technology-area members contribute to the OSG School. So this category is for OSG School effort (or other sanctioned OSG Education activities.    Admin  General administrative activities that benefit the OSG Technology area but that do not fit elsewhere \u2014  use sparingly!!    Outside  For all activities outside of the OSG Technology area (Madison team members should provide extra details, see BrianL)    Leave  This is for holidays, vacation, and sick leave; count a full day of leave as 8.0 hours, count a half day as 4.0 hours     A few thoughts about tricky situations:    Meetings. If a meeting is specific to one of the categories above, use that category. If the meeting is more general (e.g., the weekly Monday meeting, or the OSG AHM), amortize your time according to your usual breakdown by category. For example, someone who spends nearly all of their time working on development tasks should count the Monday meeting as development time.    Administrative activities. This is probably the trickiest category. It certainly covers any administrative work that pertains to your activity in the OSG Technology area. But what about administrative activities that pertain to your employment in general, and not to any particular activity? In that case, and that case only, you should amortize the administrative activity between  Admin  and  Outside  according to either (a) your appointment percentages between OSG Technology and non-Technology activities, or (b) your actual percentages between OSG Technology and non-Technology activities.    Outside (non-Technology) activities that benefit the OSG Technology area. The simplest approach is to amortize the time. The more correct approach is to figure out where credit will be given for the work; if the OSG Annual Report will describe the work in one of the Technology sections, then it should be a Technology category; otherwise not.    Learning activities. Put short amounts of learning time in their relevant development category. For instance, if Igor is showing Edgar how to use GlideTester, that goes into  Internal . But for longer training events, or for events that are less obviously related to day-to-day activities, mark the time as  Admin , and maybe add a comment explaining the activity.    Ultimately, if you are not sure how to deal with a situation, ask BrianL and he will make something up and document it here (generically) for future reference.",

If you are unsure about either the version or revision, please consult the release manager.\n\n\nDay 0: Generate Preliminary Release List\n\n\nThe release manager often needs a tentative list of packages to be released. This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release.\n\n\nStep 1: Update the osg-version RPM (3.4 only)\n\n\nFor each release (excluding upcoming), update the version number in the osg-version RPM's spec file and build it in koji:\n\n\n# If building for the latest release out of trunk\n\nosg-build koji osg-version\n\n# If building for an older release out of a branch:\n\n\nMAJOR_VERSION\n=\nMAJOR VERSION\n\nosg-build koji --repo\n=\n$MAJOR_VERSION\n osg-version\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nMAJOR VERSION\n is of the format \nx.y\n (e.g. \n3.2\n).\n\n\nStep 2: Promote osg-version (3.4 only) and generate the release list\n\n\nRun \n0-generate-pkg-list\n from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:\n\n\nVERSIONS\n=\nVERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git\n\ncd\n release-tools\n\n0\n-generate-pkg-list \n$VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: Verify Pre-Release and Generate Tarballs\n\n\nThis section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release and create the client tarballs.\n\n\nStep 1: Verify Pre-Release\n\n\nCompare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated \nrelease-list\n in git). To do this, run the \n1-verify-prerelease\n script from git:\n\n\nVERSIONS\n=\nVERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-verify-prerelease \n$VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are any discrepancies, consult the release manager. You may have to tag or untag packages with the \nosg-koji\n tool.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVerify that if there is a new version of the \nosg-tested-internal\n RPM, then it is included in the release as well!\nFor 3.4 releases, also verify that the \nosg-version\n RPM is in your set of packages for the release!\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Test Pre-Release in VM Universe\n\n\nTo test pre-release, you will be kicking off a manual VM universe test run from \nosghost.chtc.wisc.edu\n.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you meet the \npre-requisites\n for submitting VM universe test runs\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the test suite by running:\n\n\nosg-run-tests -P \nTesting OSG pre-release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd\n into the directory specified in the output of the previous command\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the DAG:\ncondor_submit_dag master-run.dag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf there are failures, consult the release-manager before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Test Pre-Release on the Madison ITB site\n\n\nTest the pre-release on the Madison ITB by following the \nITB pre-release testing instructions\n.\nIf you not local to Madison, consult the release manager for the designated person to do this testing.\n\n\nStep 4: Regenerate the build repositories\n\n\nTo avoid 404 errors when retrieving packages, it's necessary to regenerate the build repositories. Run the following script from a machine with your koji-registered user certificate:\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-regen-repos \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Create the client tarballs\n\n\nCreate the client tarballs as root on an EL7 fermicloud machine using the relevant script from git:\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git\n\ncd\n release-tools\n./1-client-tarballs \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Briefly test the client tarballs\n\n\nAs an \nunprivileged user\n, extract each tarball into a separate directory. Make sure osg-post-install works. Make sure \nosgrun osg-version\n works by running the following tests, replacing \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n with the appropriate version numbers:\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n./1-verify-tarballs \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have time, try some of the binaries, such as grid-proxy-init.\n\n\n\n\nTodo\n\n\nWe need to automate this and have it run on the proper architectures and version of RHEL.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Update the UW AFS installation of the tarball client\n\n\nThe UW keeps an install of the tarball client in \n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client\n on the UW's AFS. To update it, run the following commands:\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor\n ver in \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n;\n \ndo\n\n    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/afs-install-tarball-client \n$ver\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Wait\n\n\nWait for clearance. The OSG Release Coordinator (in consultation with the Software Team and any testers) need to sign off on the update before it is released. If you are releasing things over two days, this is a good place to stop for the day.\n\n\nDay 2: Pushing the Release\n\n\nStep 1: Push from pre-release to release\n\n\nThis script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos,\nlocks the repos and regenerates them.\n\n\nVERSIONS\n=\nVERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n-push-release \n$VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate the release notes\n\n\nThis script generates the release notes and updates the release information in AFS.\n\n\nVERSIONS\n=\nVERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n-make-notes \n$VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*.txt\n files are created and it should be verified that they've been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW's AFS.\n\n\nFor each release version, use the \n*release-note*\n files to update the relevant sections of the release note pages.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Upload the client tarballs\n\n\nUpload the tarballs to the repository with the following procedure from a UW CS machine (e.g., \ningwe\n):\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n./2-upload-tarballs \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install the tarballs into OASIS\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must be an OASIS manager of the \nmis\n VO to do these steps. Known managers as of 2014-07-22: Mat, Tim C, Tim T, Brian L. \n\n\n\n\nGet the uploader script from Git and run it with \nosgrun\n from the UW AFS install of the tarball client you made earlier. On a UW CSL machine:\n\n\nNON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n=\nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd\n /tmp\ngit clone --depth \n1\n file:///p/vdt/workspace/git/repo/tarball-client.git\n\nfor\n ver in \n$NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS\n;\n \ndo\n\n    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/sys/osgrun bash -x /tmp/tarball-client/upload-tarballs-to-oasis \n$ver\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script will automatically ssh you to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org and give you instructions to complete the process.\n\n\nStep 5: Remove old UW AFS installations of the tarball client\n\n\nTo keep space usage down, remove tarball client installations and symlinks under \n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client\n on UW's AFS that are more than 2 months old.\nTo remove them, first check the list:\n\n\nfind /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client -maxdepth \n1\n -mtime +60 -name \n3\n\\*\n -ls\n\n\n\n\n\nThen if the output looks reasonable\n(contains at least one installation, but does not contain recent installations),\nremove them:\n\n\nfind /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client -maxdepth \n1\n -mtime +60 -name \n3\n\\*\n -exec rm -rf \n{}\n +\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Update the Docker WN client\n\n\nUpdate the GitHub repo at \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn\n using the \nupdate-all\n script found in \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts\n. This requires push access to the \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn\n repo.\n\n\nInstructions for using the script:\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts.git\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn.git\ndocker-osg-wn-scripts/update-all docker-osg-wn\n\ncd\n docker-osg-wn\n\n# Verify everything looks fine and run the \ngit push\n command\n\n\n# that \nupdate-all\n should have printed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Merge any pending documentation\n\n\nFor each documentation ticket in this release, merge the pull requests mentioned in the description or comments.\n\n\nStep 8: Make release note pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the release note page from the latest software release of each series and put the new version number in the\n    file name. Edit the release number and date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert the package and RPM lists generated in Step 2 above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the list of changes, make an entry for each package that contains short descriptive text that would inform\n    a system administrator whether or not this change is of concern to them. Also, link in any release announcement\n    web page that is available for the software.

This requires push access to the \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn\n repo.\n\n\nInstructions for using the script:\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts.git\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn.git\ndocker-osg-wn-scripts/update-all docker-osg-wn\n\ncd\n docker-osg-wn\n\n# Verify everything looks fine and run the \ngit push\n command\n\n\n# that \nupdate-all\n should have printed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify the VO Package and/or CA certificates\n\n\nWait for the \nCA certificates\n to be updated.\nIt may take a while for the updates to reach the mirror used to update the web site.\nThe repository is checked hourly for updated CA certificates.\nOnce the web page is updated, run the following command to update the VO Package and/or CA certificates in the tarball installations and\nverify that the version of the VO Package and/or CA certificates match the version that was promoted to release.\n\n\n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel6/osgrun osg-update-data\n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel7/osgrun osg-update-data\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Make release note pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the release note page from the latest data release of each series and put the new version number in the\n    file name. Edit the release number and date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert the package and RPM lists generated in Step 2 above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the list of changes, make an entry for each package. (VO Package v??, and/or CA certificates based on IGTF 1.??)\n    Under each package, list the VOs or CAs affected. Usually, you can just paste this from their release announcement.\n    (At the time of writing, CA certificate and VO updates are the only packages that go into a data only release.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell check the release note pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the new pages to the release series table in \ndocs/release/notes.md\n. List the major packages that are\n    mentioned in the release announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocally serve up the web pages and ensure that the formatting looks good and the links work as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a pull request, get it approved, and merged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the web page is available, you can announce the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Announce the release\n\n\nThe following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager). If you are not the release manager, let the release manager know that they can announce the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe release manager writes the a release announcement for each version and sends it out.\n    The announcement should mention a handful of the most important updates.\n    Due to downstream formatting issues, each major change should end at column 76 or earlier.\n    Here is a sample, replace \nBRACKETED TEXT\n with the appropriate values:\n    If you are only updating certificates or only updated the VO package, delete the corresponding text:\n\n\nSubject: Announcing OSG CA Certificate and VO Package Updates\nSubject: Announcing OSG CA Certificate Update\nSubject: Announcing VO Package Update\n\nWe are pleased to announce a data release for the OSG Software Stack.\nData releases do not contain any software changes.\n\nThis release contains updated CA Certificates based on IGTF \nVERSION\n:\n- \nChange 1 from IGTF changelog\n\n- \nChange 2 from IGTF changelog\n\n\nThis release contains VO Package v\nVERSION\n:\nThis release also contains VO Package v\nVERSION\n:\n- \nChange 1 from VO changelog\n\n- \nChange 2 from VO changelog\n\n\nRelease notes and pointers to more documentation can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.opensciencegrid.org/docs/release/\nSERIES.VERSION\n/release-\nRELEASE-VERSION\n/\n\nNeed help?

Copy or checkout the \nosgitb/htcondor-tests\n\ndirectory to get the test directories.\n\n\nPart \u2160: Submitting jobs directly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange into the \n1-direct-jobs\n subdirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are old result files in the directory, remove them:\n\n\nmake distclean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the test workflow\n\n\ncondor_submit_dag test.dag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck\n\n\nIn the initial test runs, the entire workflow ran in a few minutes.  If the DAG or jobs exit immediately, go on\nhold, or otherwise fail, then you have some troubleshooting to do!  Keep trying steps 2 and 3 until you get a clean\nrun (or one or more HTCondor bug tickets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the final output file:\n\n\ncat count-by-hostnames.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a reasonable distribution of jobs by hostname, keeping in mind the different number of cores per\nmachine and the fact that HTCondor can and will reuse claims to process many jobs on a single host.  Especially\nwatch out for a case in which no jobs run on the newly updated hosts (at the time of writing: \nitb-data[456]\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Clean up, using the \nmake clean\n or \nmake distclean\n commands.  Use the \nclean\n target to remove\n   intermediate result and log files generated by a workflow run but preserve the final output file; use the \ndistclean\n\n   target to remove all workflow-generated files (plus Emacs backup files).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart \u2161: Submitting jobs using HTCondor-C\n\n\nIf direct submissions fail, there is probably no point to doing this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange into the \n2-htcondor-c-jobs\n subdirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are old result files in the directory, remove them:\n\n\nmake distclean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a proxy for your X.509 credentials\n\n\nvoms-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the test workflow\n\n\ncondor_submit_dag test.dag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck\n\n\nIn the initial test runs, the entire workflow ran in 10 minutes or less; generally, this test takes longer than the\ndirect submission test, because of the layers of indirection.  Also, status updates from the CEs back to the submit\nhost are infrequent.  For direct information about the CEs, log in to \nitb-ce1\n and \nitb-ce2\n to check status; don\u2019t\nforget to check both \ncondor_ce_q\n and \ncondor_q\n on the CEs, probably in that order.\n\n\nIf the DAG or jobs exit immediately, go on hold, or otherwise fail, then you have some troubleshooting to do!  Keep\ntrying steps 2 and 3 until you get a clean run (or one or more HTCondor bug tickets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the final output file:\n\n\ncat count-by-hostnames.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, look for a reasonable distribution of jobs by hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Clean up, using the \nmake clean\n or \nmake distclean\n commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart \u2162: Submitting jobs from a GlideinWMS VO Frontend\n\n\nFor this workflow, use your personal space on \nglidein3.chtc.wisc.edu\n.  Copy or checkout the \nosgitb/htcondor-tests\n\ndirectory to get the test directories.  Again, if previous steps fail, do not bother with this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange into the \n3-frontend-jobs\n subdirectory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are old result files in the directory, remove them:\n\n\nmake distclean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the test workflow\n\n\ncondor_submit_dag test.dag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck\n\n\nThis workflow could take much longer than the first two, maybe an hour or so.  Also, unless there are active\nglideins, it will take 10 minutes or longer for the first glideins to appear and start matching jobs.  Thus it is\nhelpful to monitor \ncondor_q -totals\n until all of the jobs are submitted (there should be 2001), then switch to\nmonitoring \ncondor_status\n until glideins start appearing.  After the first jobs start running and finishing, it is\nprobably safe to ignore the rest of the run.  If the jobs do not appear in the local queue, if glideins do not\nappear, or if jobs do not start running on the glideins, it is time to start troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the final output file:\n\n\ncat count-by-hostnames.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of jobs per execute node may be more skewed than in the first two workflows, due to the way in\nwhich pilots ramp up over time and how HTCondor allocates jobs to slots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Clean up, using the \nmake clean\n or \nmake distclean\n commands.",

The production CE Collectors run at the GOC, but you may want to set up your own for testing.\n\n\n\n\nMake 2 VMs with the EPEL/OSG repos installed: one for the collector, and one for the CE\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up the Collector\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nhtcondor-ce-collector\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n that contains this line:\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD = $(COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD), your_htcondor_ce_host.example.net\n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(with \nyour_htcondor_ce_host\n replaced by the hostname the HTCondor-CE VM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nservice condor-ce-collector start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up the CE\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nosg-htcondor-ce-condor\n (replace condor with the batch system of your choice)\n\n\nEnsure osg-configure \n= 1.0.60-2 is installed\n\n\n\n\nConfigure your CE using osg-configure\n\n\n\n\nYou should use the \nHTCondor-CE Install Docs\n as a reference, although you can skip several of the steps\n\n\nYou can skip setting up Squid: set \nenabled\n to \nTrue\n and \nlocation\n to \nUNAVAILABLE\n in \n01-squid.ini\n\n\nSet \nhtcondor_gateway_enabled\n to \nTrue\n in \n10-gateway.ini\n\n\nYou probably don't need GUMS, but if you want it, use the Fermi GUMS server (set \ngums_host\n to \ngums.fnal.gov\n and \nauthorization_method\n to \nxacml\n in 10-misc.ini)\n\n\n\n\nTo keep osg-configure from complaining about storage, edit \n10-storage.ini\n:\n\n\n\n\nSet \nse_available\n to \nFalse\n\n\nSet \napp_dir\n to \n/osg/app_dir\n\n\nSet \ndata_dir\n to \n/osg/data_dir\n\n\nDo \nmkdir -p /osg/app_dir/etc; mkdir -p /osg/data_dir; chmod 1777 /osg/app_dir{,/etc}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable your batch system by setting \nenabled\n to \nTrue\n in \n20-\nbatch system\n.ini\n\n\n\n\nSet up the site info in \n40-siteinfo.ini\n ; in particular, you'll need to set the \nresource\n and \nresource_group\n settings\n    \\ (you just need to pick a name; I concatenate my login name with the short host name and use that, e.g. matyasfermicloud001).\n    \\ You can also use the following settings:\n\n\ngroup=OSG-ITB\n\n\nsponsor=local\n\n\ncity=Batavia, IL\n\n\ncountry=US\n\n\nlongitude=-88\n\n\nlatitude=41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini\n and set \nce_collectors\n to the collector host\n\n\n\n\nRun \nosg-configure -dc\n\n\nStart up your batch system\n\n\nRun \nservice condor-ce start\n\n\n\n\nThe CE will report to the collector host every five minutes. If you want to force it to send now, run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n. You should see your CE if you run \ncondor_ce_status -schedd\n on the collector host.\n\n\nRSV\n\n\nTesting a fresh installation:\n\n\n\n\nmake sure the yum repositories required by OSG is installed on your host\n\n\nrpm -Uvh \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el7-release-latest.rpm\n OR rpm -Uvh \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nalso make sure epel repo is set up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall the rpm\n\n\nyum --enablerepo=osg-testing install rsv \n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini file\n\n\nin my case, I don't have a service cert for testing, so I use my own personal cert to create the proxy, but later on the owner of the proxy should be changed to \"rsv\" user that is created during the rpm install.\n\n\nin the config file, for the ce_hosts and gridftp_hosts, put in a test server, as the result from this test will be uploaded to OSG GOC, which may mess up your production service monitoring if you chose a production server for the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure -v\n\n\nosg-configure -c\n\n\n/etc/init.d/condor-cron start\n\n\n/etc/init.d/rsv start\n\n\nrsv-control --list\n\n\nrsv-control --version\n\n\nrsv-control --run --all-enabled 11. make sure the results from the above commands look fine.\n\n\n\n\nTesting an upgrade installation:\n\n\n\n\nmake sure to enable the osg-testing repo, and set its priority higher than the other repos\n\n\nyum --enablerepo=osg-testing upgrade rsv*\n\n\nyou can use the old 30-rsv.ini file for configuration\n\n\nrepeat steps 4)~11) as mentioned in the last section.\n\n\n\n\nSlurm\n\n\nThis section goes through the steps needed to set up a slurm install on a VM. This is a necessary prerequisite for testing Slurm related components (CE integration, gratia, etc.). Note that the slurm setup used for this uses weak passwords for mysql. It should be sufficient for a quick setup, testing, and then tear down but should not be used without changes if it will be running for any appreciable length of time.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nneed to have a VM with 2+ GB of memory\n\n\n\n\nInstallation and setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload scripts and config files: \n\n\ncd /tmp/\ngit clone \nhttps://github.com/sthapa/utilities.git\n\ncd utilities/slurm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetup and install slurm components\n\n\nexport username=\nUSERNAME\n \\# user that jobs will run as\nexport version=\n14.11.7\n \\# slurm version to install (e.g. 16.05.2 or 14.11.7)\n./slurm-setup.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter successful completion, slurm and slurm gratia probes should be setup and enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a job using slurm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate test.sh with the following:\n\n\n#/bin/bash\necho \nIn the directory: `pwd`\n echo \nAs the user: `whoami`\n echo \u201cHostname:\n /bin/hostname sleep 60 \n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrun \nsbatch test.sh\n\n\n\n\nthe output from the jobs should appear in the current working directory as \ntest.sh.[eo].nnnnn\n where nnnnn is a job id\n\n\n\n\nVO Client\n\n\nThis document contains a basic recipe for testing a VO Package release\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nTesting the VO package requires a few components:\n   * X.509 certificate with membership to at least one VO\n   * System with working GUMS installation\n   * System with OSG installation (voms-proxy-init and edg-mkgridmap)\n\n\nTesting \nvoms-proxy-init\n\n\nLogin in the system that has voms-proxy-init installed.  Make sure that you have the correct \nvo-client rpms installed and that your X.509 certificate is in your home directory.  For each\nVO that you have membership in, run the following \nvoms-proxy-init -voms [VO]\n where \n[VO]\n is \nthe appropriate VO (e.g. osg, cms, etc.).  You should be able to generate a voms-proxy for that\nVO without errors.\n\n\nXRootD VOMS Testing\n\n\nThis section is intended for OSG Software/Release teams to gather information on testing vomsxrd/xrootd-voms-plugin package. Original plugin named \nvomsxrd\n, similar to lcmaps that extracts information for authorization within xrootd of a proxy's voms extension.\n\n\nYou need an \nxrootd server installation\n\n\nIn the xrootd server yum install the following packages:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd-voms-plugin\n\n\nvo-client\n\n\n\n\nIn the xrootd client yum install the following packages:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd-client\n\n\nvoms-clients\n\n\nvo-client\n\n\n\n\nIn the xrootd server add this lines to file \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nxrootd.seclib /usr/lib64/libXrdSec.so\nsec.protparm gsi -vomsfun:/usr/lib64/libXrdSecgsiVOMS.so -vomsfunparms:certfmt=raw|vos=cms|dbg -vomsat:2\nsec.protocol /usr/lib64 gsi -ca:1 -crl:3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis configuration will only authorize members of VO \ncms\n. You can change it to another VO.\n\n\nMake sure \nfetch-crl\n has been run otherwise the xrootd service may fail to start.\n\n\nIn the xrootd client get a proxy without voms extension or with another VO extension different that the one used in the configuration:\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-init -voms mis\n\nEnter GRID pass phrase:\n\n\nYour identity: /DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=People/CN=Edgar Mauricio Fajardo Hernandez 2020\n\n\nCreating temporary proxy ...........................

This document solely covers the policy aspects.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe OSG provides a network of CVMFS Stratum-1 servers for mirroring content of externally-managed repositories.  These repositories are often\nhosted by large HEP or physics VOs for the purpose of distributing software for high-throughput computing jobs.  Additionally, OSG provides a\nrepository (\n) for smaller VOs; this is not covered here.\n\n\nOSG will include additional repositories into the content distribution network (CDN) at the request of an OSG-affiliated VO.

Intended for end-users.\n\n\nosg-release\n: This is the official, production release of the software stack.\n    This is the main repository for end-users.\n\n\nosg-contrib\n: This is where software goes that is not officially supported by the OSG Software Team,\n    but we provide as a convenience for software our users might find useful.\n\n\n\n\nWe also create a repository per release, called \nosg-release-VERSION\n (such as osg-release-3.0.4).\nThis is intended mostly for testing purposes, though users may occasionally find it useful.\n\n\nOccasionally there may be other repositories for specific short-term purposes.\n\n\nVersion Numbers\n\n\nThere is a single version number that is used to summarize the contents of the \nosg-release\n repository.\nHaving a single version number is very useful for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n\n\n\nEvery time changes are made to the \nosg-release\n repository, we update the version number and write release notes.\n\n\nWe have a shorthand for referring to the state of the repository; we can talk about specific releases.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are important caveats about the version number:\n\n\n\n\nEven if a user says they have installed Version X, it may not be an accurate reflection of what they have installed:\n    they may have chosen to update some of their software from a previous version.\n    To truly understand what they have installed, the entire set of RPMs installed on their computer must be considered.\n\n\nThe version number is only meaningful in the \nosg-release\n repository, though for technical reasons it's present (as\n    an RPM) in other repositories.\n\n\n\n\nThe version number is communicated in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nEvery time a new release is made, the version number is updated.\n    All release notes and communication to users about this release uses the new version number.\n\n\nThere is an \nosg-version\n RPM that reports the version of the release.

Readying the release\n\n\nWhen we are ready to make a production release, we first move the correct subset of packages from \nosg-testing\n into\n\nosg-prerelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n.\nThis should be done after checking with the OSG Release Manager to verify that it's okay to release the software.\nThe intention of \nosg-prerelease\n is to do a final verification that we have the correct set of packages for release and\nthat they really work together.\nThe intention of \nosg-rolling\n is to make thoroughly tested software available to users before its first point release.\nThis is important because the \nosg-testing\n repository might contain a mix of packages that are ready for release with\npackages that are not ready for release.\nWhen moving packages to \nosg-prerelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n, the team member doing the release will:\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the osg-version RPM to reflect the new version.\n    Push this RPM through \nosg-development\n, \nosg-testing\n, and into \nosg-prerelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n.\n\n\nFind the correct set of packages to push from \nosg-testing\n into \nosg-prerelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n.\n\n\nAt a minimum, run the automated test suite on the contents of \nosg-prerelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n.\n    In cases were more extensive testing is needed, or the test suite doesn't sufficiently cover the testing needs, do\n    specific ad-hoc testing.\n    (If appropriate, consider proposing extensions to the automated test suite.)\n\n\n\n\nWe expect that in most cases, this process of updating and testing the \nosg-prelease\n and \nosg-rolling\n repositories\nwill be less than one day.\nIf there are urgent security updates to release, this process may be shortened.\n\n\nMoving packages to osg-release\n\n\nWhen the \nosg-prerelease\n repository has been updated and verified, all of the changed software can be moved into the\n\nosg-release\n repository.\nAs part of this move, two important tasks must be done:\n\n\n\n\nRecord the complete set of packages in the new release repository.\n\n\nUpdate the \nRelease Notes\n.\n    Note that each release has a separate page to describe the release, and it's linked from the main page.\n    The individual page lists the changes at a high level (i.e. Updated package X to version Y) and the complete set of\n    RPMs that changed.\n\n\nCreate a ticket on ticket.opensciencegrid.org with a release announcement.\n    Operations will distribute it to the right places.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we will make another Koji tag/yum repository called \nosg-release-VERSION\n.\nAll of the latest packages in osg-release will be tagged to be in this repository, and the tag will be locked.\nThis will give us a reproducible way to install any given OSG Software release.\n\n\nMoving packages to osg-release-VERSION\n\n\nWhen we make a specific release, we copy the osg-release repository to a versioned osg-release-VERSION repository.\nThis allows us to do testing with specific versions and in rare cases allows users to use a specific release.\n\n\nMoving packages to osg-contrib\n\n\nThe \nosg-contrib\n repository is loosely regulated.\nIn most cases, the team member in charge of the package can decide when a package is updated in \nosg-contrib\n.\nContrib packages should be tested in \nosg-development\n first.\n\n\nTiming of releases\n\n\nCode freezes happen two business days in advance of the release (normally Friday).\nSpecifically: RPM updates intended to be included in the next release (that is, pushed to the osg-release yum repo) must\nbe in the osg-testing yum repo by noon Central Time two business days in advance of the release.\nThis will allow time for final testing, discussions, reverts, etc.\n\n\nWe will make exceptions for urgent situations; consult with the release manager when needed.\n\n\nCA Certificates and VO Client packages\n\n\nPackages that contain only data are not part of the usual release cycle.\nCurrently, these are the CA certificate packages and the VO Client packages.\nUpdates to these packages come from the Security Team and Software Team, respectively.\nThey still move through the usual process for release, and the Software and Release Managers decide when these packages\nshould be promoted to the next repository level.\nHowever, the actual releases of these packages do not increment the version number of the software stack.\n\n\nThe release process for data packages is discussed here.",

The validation is meant to be distributed: the VOMS client does not\n    need to contact the VOMS-Admin server.  However, OSG has historically used software\n    such as GUMS or \nedg-mkgridmap\n to cache a list of authorizations from the VOMS-Admin\n    interface, creating a dependency between VOMS client and VOMS-Admin.\n\n\n\n\nVOMS-Admin is a large, complex Java web application.  Over the last\nfew years, upstream support has tailed off - particularly as OSG has been unable\nto update to VOMS-Admin version 3.  As a result, the maintenance burden has largely\nfallen on the OSG Software team.\n\n\nGiven that VOMS-Admin is deeply tied to X509 security infrastructure - and is\nmaintenance-only from OSG Software - there is no path forward to eliminate the use\nof X509 certificates in the web browser, a high-priority goal\n\n\nIn discussions with the OSG community, we have found very few VOs utilize VOMS-Admin\nto manage their VO users.  Instead, the majority use VOMS-Admin to whitelist a pilot\ncertificate: this can be done without a VOMS-Admin endpoint.\n\n\nOSG's plans to retire VOMS-Admin has three major components:\n\n\n\n\n(Sites) Enable distributed validation of VOMS extensions in the VOMS client.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate VOs that use VOMS only for pilot certificates to direct signing\n  of VOMS proxies.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate remaining VOs to a central \ncomanage\n instance for managing user\n  authorizations; maintain a plugin to enable direct callouts from VOMS-Server\n  to \ncomanage\n for authorization lookups.\n\n\n\n\nSite Transition Plans\n\n\nWe will release a configuration of the LCMAPS authorization framework that performs\ndistributed verification of VOMS extensions; this verification eludes the need to\ncontact the VOMS-Admin interface for a list of authorizations.\n\n\nIn 2015/2016, LCMAPS and GUMS were upgraded so GUMS skips the VOMS-Admin lookup when\nLCMAPS asserts the validation was performed.  Hence, when GUMS sites update clients to the\nlatest (April 2017) LCMAPS and HTCondor-CE releases, the callout to VOMS-Admin is no longer\nneeded. \nNote\n: In parallel to the VOMS-Admin transition, OSG Software plans to \nretire GUMS\n.\nThere is no need to complete one transition before the other.\n\n\nSites using \nedg-mkgridmap\n will need to use its replacement, \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n (this\nprocess is documented \nhere\n).\n\n\nVO Transition Plans\n\n\nBased on one-to-one discussions, we believe the majority of VOs only use VOMS-Admin to maintain\na list of authorized pilots.  For these VOs, we will help convert invocations of \nvoms-proxy-init\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-init -voms hcc:/hcc/Role=pilot\n\n\n\n\n\nto an equivalent call to \nvoms-proxy-fake\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-fake -hostcert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\\n                -hostkey /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem \\\n                -fqan /hcc/Role=pilot/Capability=NULL \\\n                -voms hcc -uri hcc-voms.unl.edu:15000\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter command would typically be run on the VO's glideinWMS frontend host, requiring the service certificate\ncurrently on the VOMS-Admin server to be kept on the frontend host.  The frontend's account may also need access\nto the certificate.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nSee \nthis documentation\n to\nupdate your GlideinWMS Frontend to use the new proxy generation command.\n\n\n\n\nWe plan to transition more complex VOs - those using VOMS-Admin to track membership in a VO - to \ncomanage\n.

            "text": "Migrating to Markdown\n\n\nAs part of the TWiki retirement (the read-only target date of Oct 1, 2017, with a shutdown date in 2018), we will need to convert the OSG Software and Release3 docs from TWiki syntax to \nMarkdown\n. The following document outlines the conversion process and conventions.\n\n\nChoosing the git repository\n\n\nFirst you will need to choose which git repoository you will be working with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are converting a document from...\n\n\nUse this github repository...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftwareTeam\n\n\ntechnology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease3\n\n\ndocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've chosen the target repository for your document, move onto the next section and pick your conversion method.\n\n\nAutomatic TWiki conversion\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are only archiving the documents, skip to this \nsection\n.\n\n\n\n\nChoose one of the following methods for converting TWiki documents:\n\n\n\n\nUsing our own \ndocker conversion image\n (recommended)\n\n\nDirectly using pandoc and mkdocs \non your own machine\n\n\n\n\nUsing docker\n\n\nThe twiki-converter docker image can be used to preview the document tree via a \nmkdocs\n development server, archive TWiki documents, and convert documents to Markdown via \npandoc\n. The image is available on \nosghost\n, otherwise, it is availble on \ndockerhub\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker pull opensciencegrid/docker-twiki-converter\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nTo perform a document migration using docker, you will need the following tools and accounts:\n\n\n\n\nFork\n and\n  \nclone\n the\n  repository that you chose in the \nabove section\n\n\nA host with a running docker service\n\n\nsudo\n or membership in the \ndocker\n group\n\n\n\n\nIf you cannot install the above tools locally, they are available on \nosghost\n. Speak with Brian L for access.\n\n\nPreparing the git repository\n\n\n\n\ncd\n into your local git repository\n\n\n\n\nAdd \nopensciencegrid/technology\n as the upstream remote repository for merging upstream changes:\n\n\nuser@host $\n git remote add upstream https://www.github.com/opensciencegrid/technology.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch for the document you plan to convert:\n\n\nuser@host $\n git branch \nBRANCH NAME\n master\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nBRANCH NAME\n with a name of your choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange to the branch you just created\n\n\nuser@host $\n git checkout \nBRANCH NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nBRANCH NAME\n with the name you chose in the step above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviewing the document tree\n\n\nWhen starting a twiki-converter docker container, it expects your local github repository to be mounted in \n/source\n so that any changes made to the repository are reflected in the mkdocs development server. To start a docker container based off of the twiki-converter docker image:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a container from the image with the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker run -d -v \nPATH TO LOCAL GITHUB REPO\n:/source -p \n8000\n opensciencegrid/docker-twiki-converter\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nPATH TO LOCAL GITHUB REPO\n for the directory where you have cloned the repo. The above command should return the container ID, which will be used in subsequent commands.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the docker container exits immediately, remove the \n-d\n option for details. If you see permission denied errors, you may need to disable SELinux or put it in permissive mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the port that your development server is listening on, use the container ID (you should only need the first few chars of the ID) returned from the previous command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker port \nCONTAINER ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nCONTAINER ID\n for the value returned by the execution of the previous command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess the development server in your browser via \nhttp://osghost.chtc.wisc.edu:\nPORT\n or \nlocalhost:\nPORT\n for containers run on \nosghost\n or locally, respectively. \nosghost\n has a restrictive firewall so if you have issues accessing your container from outside of the UW-Madison campus, use an SSH tunnel to map the \nosghost\n port to a local port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting documents\n\n\nThe docker image contains a convenience script, \nconvert-twiki\n for saving archives and converting them to Markdown. To run the script in a running container, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker \nexec\n \nCONTAINER ID\n convert-twiki \nTWIKI URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCONTAINER ID\n is the docker container ID and \nTWIKI URL\n is the link to the TWiki document that you want to convert, e.g. https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess . This will result in an archive of the twiki doc, \narchive/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess\n, in your local repo and a converted copy, \nSoftwareDevelopmentProcess.md\n, placed into the root of your local github repository.  If the twiki url is for a specific revision of the document, a \n.rNN\n will be included in the output filenames.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf the above command does not complete quickly, it means that Pandoc is having an issue with a specific section of the document. See \nTroubleshooting conversion\n for next steps.\n\n\n\n\nTo see the converted document in your browser:\n\n\n\n\nRename, move the converted document into a folder in \ndocs/\n.\n\n\nDocument file names should be lowercase, \n-\n delimited, and descriptive but concise, e.g. \nmarkdown-migration.md\n or \ncutting-release.md\n\n\nIt's not important to get the name/location correct on the first try as this can be discussed in the pull request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsudo chown\n the archived and converted documents to be owned by you\n\n\nAdd the document to the \npages:\n section of \nmkdocs.yml\n in \ntitle case\n, e.g. \n- Migrating Documents to Markdown: 'software/markdown-migration.md'\n\n\nRefresh the document tree in your browser\n\n\n\n\nOnce you can view the converted document in your browser, move onto the \nnext section\n\n\nTroubleshooting conversion\n\n\nPandoc sometimes has issues converting documents and requires manual intervention by removing whichever section is causing issues in the conversion.\n\n\n\n\nCopy the archive of the document into the root of your git repository\n\n\n\n\nKill the process in the docker container:\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker \nexec\n \nCONTAINER ID\n pkill -9 pandoc\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCONTAINER ID\n is the docker container ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove a section from the copy of the archive to find the problematic section (recommendation: use a binary search strategy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun pandoc manually:\n\n\nuser@host $\n docker \nexec\n \nCONTAINER ID\n pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github \nARCHIVE COPY\n \n \nMARKDOWN FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCONTAINER ID\n is the docker container ID, \nARCHIVE COPY\n is the the file you copied in the first step\nand \nMARKDOWN FILE\n is the resulting \n.md\n file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat steps 2-4 until you've narrowed down the problematic section\n\n\n\n\nManually convert the offending section\n\n\n\n\nConversion without Docker\n\n\nIf you've already used the \ndocker method\n, skip to the section about \ncompleting the conversion\n. \n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThis method requires the following:\n\n\n\n\nFork\n and \nclone\n the repository that you chose in the \nabove section\n\n\npandoc (\n 1.16)\n\n\nmkdocs\n\n\nMarkdownHighlight\n\n\npygments\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the git repository\n\n\n\n\ncd\n into your local git repository\n\n\n\n\nAdd \nopensciencegrid/technology\n as the upstream remote repository for merging upstream changes:\n\n\nuser@host $\n git remote add upstream https://www.github.com/opensciencegrid/technology.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch for the document you plan to convert:\n\n\nuser@host $\n git branch \nBRANCH NAME\n master\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nBRANCH NAME\n with a name of your choice\n5. Change to the branch you just created\n\n\nuser@host $\n git checkout \nBRANCH NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nBRANCH NAME\n with the name you chose in the step above\n\n\nArchiving the TWiki document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions for \narchival\n then continue to the next section to convert the document with pandoc.\n\n\nInitial conversion with Pandoc\n\n\nPandoc\n is a tool that's useful for automated conversion of markdown languages. \nOnce installed\n (alternatively, run pandoc \nvia docker\n), run the following command to convert TWiki to Markdown:\n\n\n$\n pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github \nTWIKI FILE\n \n \nMARKDOWN FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTWIKI FILE\n is the path to initial document in raw TWiki and \nMARKDOWN FILE\n is the path to the resulting document in GitHub Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you don't see output from the above command quickly, it means that Pandoc is having an issue with a specific section of the document. Stop the command (or docker container), find and temporarily remove the offending section, convert the remainder of the document with Pandoc, and manually convert the offending section.\n\n\n\n\nPreviewing your document(s) with Mkdocs\n\n\nMkdocs\n has a development mode that can be used to preview documents as you work on them and is available via package manager or \npip\n. \nOnce installed\n, add your document(s) to the \npages\n section of \nmkdocs.yml\n and launch the mkdocs server with the following command from the dir containing \nmkdocs.yml\n:\n\n\n$\n \nPYTHONPATH\n=\nsrc/ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess the server at \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n and navigate to the document you're working on. It's useful to open the original TWiki doc in an adjacent tab or window to quickly compare the two.\n\n\nCompleting the conversion\n\n\nManual review of the automatically converted documents are required since the automatic conversion process isn't perfect. This section contains a list of problems commonly encountered in automatically converted documents.\n\n\nVisit the \nstyle guide\n to ensure that the document meets all style guidelines.\n\n\nArchiving Documents\n\n\nIf the document is slated for archival (check if it says \"yes\" in the  \"archived\" column of the spreadsheet), just download the document to the \narchive\n folder of your local git repository:\n\n\nuser@host $\n \ncd\n technology/\n\nuser@host $\n curl \nTWIKI URL\n?raw=text\n \n|\n iconv -f windows-1252 \n archive/\nTWIKI TITLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTWIKI URL\n is the link to the TWiki document that you want to download and \nTWIKI TITLE\n is the name that will receive the archived file\nFor example:\n\n\nuser@host $\n \ncd\n technology\n\nuser@host $\n curl \nhttps://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance?raw=text\n \n|\n iconv -f windows-1252 \n archive/SHA2Compliance\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter downloading the document, continue onto the next section to walk through pull request submission.\n\n\nSubmitting the pull request\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage the archived raw TWiki (as well as the converted Markdown document(s) and \nmkdocs.yml\n if you are converting the document):\n\n\nuser@host $\n git add mkdocs.yml archive/\nTWIKI ARCHIVE\n \nPATH TO CONVERTED DOC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTWIKI ARCHIVE\n is the name of the archived document and \nPATH TO CONVERTED DOC\n is the path to the \n.md\n\nfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit and push your changes to your GitHub repo:\n\n\nuser@host $\n git commit -m \nCOMMIT MSG\n\n\nuser@host $\n git push origin \nBRANCH NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nCOMMIT MSG\n for a meaningful text that describes the conversion done and \nBRANCH NAME\n with the name\nchosen in the 3rd step of the \nPreparing the git repository\n section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to your GitHub fork\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a pull request containing with the following body:\n\n\nLINK TO TWIKI DOCUMENT\n\n\n- [ ] Enter date into \nMigrated\n column of google sheet\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of \nLINK TO TWIKI DOCUMENT\n is: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are migrating a document, also add this task:\n\n\n- [ ] Add migration header to TWiki document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are archiving a document, add this task:\n\n\n- [ ] Move TWiki document to the trash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee an example pull request \nhere\n.\n\n\nAfter the pull request\n\n\nAfter the pull request is merged, replace the contents of TWiki document with the div if you're migrating the document, linking to the location of the migrated document:\n\n\ndiv style=\nborder: 1px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em; background-color: #FFDDDD; font-weight: 600;\n\nThis document has been migrated to !GitHub (\nLINK TO GITHUB DOCUMENT\n). If you wish to see the old TWiki document, use the TWiki history below.\n\nBackground:\n\nAt the end of year (2017), the TWiki will be retired in favor of !GitHub. You can find the various TWiki webs and their new !GitHub locations listed below:\n\n   * Release3: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/docs ([[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/tree/master/archive][archive]])\n   * !SoftwareTeam: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/technology ([[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/technology/tree/master/archive][archive]])\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are archiving a document, move it to the trash instead. Once the document has been updated or trashed, add the date to the spreadsheet and go back to your pull request and mark your tasks as complete. For example, if you completed the migration of a document:\n\n\n- [X] Enter date into \nMigrated\n column of google sheet\n- [X] Add migration div to TWiki document\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, we do not recommend changing backlinks (links on other twiki pages that refer to the Twiki page you are migrating) to point at the new GitHub URL.  This is to provide a simple reminder to users that the migration will occur, and also is likely low priority regardless as all pages will eventually migrate to GitHub.  This advice may change in the future as we gain experience with this transition.\n\n\nReviewing pull requests\n\n\nTo review pull requests, \ncd\n into the dir containing your git repository and check out the requester's branch, which the twiki-converter container should automatically notice. Here's an example checking out Brian's \ncut-sw-release\n branch of the technology repository:\n\n\n#\n Add the requester\ns repo as a remote if you haven\nt already\n\nuser@host $\n git remote add blin https://www.github.com/brianhlin/technology.git\n\nuser@host $\n git fetch --all\n\nuser@host $\n git checkout blin/cut-sw-release\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh your browser and navigate to the document in the request.",
