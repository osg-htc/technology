The following document outlines the conversion process and conventions. Choosing the git repository \u00b6 First you will need to choose which git repoository you will be working with: If you are converting a document from... Use this github repository... SoftwareTeam technology Release3 docs Once you've chosen the target repository for your document, move onto the next section and pick your conversion method. Automatic TWiki conversion \u00b6 Note If you are only archiving the documents, skip to this section . Choose one of the following methods for converting TWiki documents: Using our own docker conversion image (recommended) Directly using pandoc and mkdocs on your own machine Using docker \u00b6 The twiki-converter docker image can be used to preview the document tree via a mkdocs development server, archive TWiki documents, and convert documents to Markdown via pandoc . The image is available on osghost , otherwise, it is availble on dockerhub . user@host $ docker pull opensciencegrid/docker-twiki-converter Requirements \u00b6 To perform a document migration using docker, you will need the following tools and accounts: Fork and clone the repository that you chose in the above section A host with a running docker service sudo or membership in the docker group If you cannot install the above tools locally, they are available on osghost . Speak with Brian L for access. Preparing the git repository \u00b6 cd into your local git repository Add opensciencegrid/technology as the upstream remote repository for merging upstream changes: user@host $ git remote add upstream https://www.github.com/opensciencegrid/technology.git Create a branch for the document you plan to convert: user@host $ git branch <BRANCH NAME> master Replace <BRANCH NAME> with a name of your choice Change to the branch you just created user@host $ git checkout <BRANCH NAME> Replace <BRANCH NAME> with the name you chose in the step above Previewing the document tree \u00b6 When starting a twiki-converter docker container, it expects your local github repository to be mounted in /source so that any changes made to the repository are reflected in the mkdocs development server. To start a docker container based off of the twiki-converter docker image: Create a container from the image with the following command: user@host $ docker run -d -v <PATH TO LOCAL GITHUB REPO>:/source -p 8000 opensciencegrid/docker-twiki-converter Change <PATH TO LOCAL GITHUB REPO> for the directory where you have cloned the repo. The above command should return the container ID, which will be used in subsequent commands. Note If the docker container exits immediately, remove the -d option for details. If you see permission denied errors, you may need to disable SELinux or put it in permissive mode. To find the port that your development server is listening on, use the container ID (you should only need the first few chars of the ID) returned from the previous command: user@host $ docker port <CONTAINER ID> Change <CONTAINER ID> for the value returned by the execution of the previous command Access the development server in your browser via http://osghost.chtc.wisc.edu:<PORT> or localhost:<PORT> for containers run on osghost or locally, respectively. osghost has a restrictive firewall so if you have issues accessing your container from outside of the UW-Madison campus, use an SSH tunnel to map the osghost port to a local port. Converting documents \u00b6 The docker image contains a convenience script, convert-twiki for saving archives and converting them to Markdown. To run the script in a running container, run the following command: user@host $ docker exec <CONTAINER ID> convert-twiki <TWIKI URL> Where <CONTAINER ID> is the docker container ID and <TWIKI URL> is the link to the TWiki document that you want to convert, e.g. https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess . This will result in an archive of the twiki doc, archive/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess , in your local repo and a converted copy, SoftwareDevelopmentProcess.md , placed into the root of your local github repository. If the twiki url is for a specific revision of the document, a .rNN will be included in the output filenames. Warning If the above command does not complete quickly, it means that Pandoc is having an issue with a specific section of the document. See Troubleshooting conversion for next steps. To see the converted document in your browser: Rename, move the converted document into a folder in docs/ . Document file names should be lowercase, - delimited, and descriptive but concise, e.g. markdown-migration.md or cutting-release.md It's not important to get the name/location correct on the first try as this can be discussed in the pull request sudo chown the archived and converted documents to be owned by you Add the document to the pages: section of mkdocs.yml in APA-style title case , e.g. - Migrating Documents to Markdown: 'software/markdown-migration.md' Refresh the document tree in your browser Once you can view the converted document in your browser, move onto the next section Troubleshooting conversion \u00b6 Pandoc sometimes has issues converting documents and requires manual intervention by removing whichever section is causing issues in the conversion. Copy the archive of the document into the root of your git repository Kill the process in the docker container: user@host $ docker exec <CONTAINER ID> pkill -9 pandoc Where <CONTAINER ID> is the docker container ID Remove a section from the copy of the archive to find the problematic section (recommendation: use a binary search strategy) Run pandoc manually: user@host $ docker exec <CONTAINER ID> pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github <ARCHIVE COPY> > <MARKDOWN FILE> Where <CONTAINER ID> is the docker container ID, <ARCHIVE COPY> is the the file you copied in the first step and <MARKDOWN FILE> is the resulting .md file Repeat steps 2-4 until you've narrowed down the problematic section Manually convert the offending section Conversion without Docker \u00b6 If you've already used the docker method , skip to the section about completing the conversion . Requirements \u00b6 This method requires the following: Fork and clone the repository that you chose in the above section pandoc (> 1.16) mkdocs MarkdownHighlight pygments Preparing the git repository \u00b6 cd into your local git repository Add opensciencegrid/technology as the upstream remote repository for merging upstream changes: user@host $ git remote add upstream https://www.github.com/opensciencegrid/technology.git Create a branch for the document you plan to convert: user@host $ git branch <BRANCH NAME> master Replace <BRANCH NAME> with a name of your choice 5. Change to the branch you just created user@host $ git checkout <BRANCH NAME> Replace <BRANCH NAME> with the name you chose in the step above Archiving the TWiki document \u00b6 Follow the instructions for archival then continue to the next section to convert the document with pandoc. Initial conversion with Pandoc \u00b6 Pandoc is a tool that's useful for automated conversion of markdown languages. Once installed (alternatively, run pandoc via docker ), run the following command to convert TWiki to Markdown: $ pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github <TWIKI FILE> > <MARKDOWN FILE> Where <TWIKI FILE> is the path to initial document in raw TWiki and <MARKDOWN FILE> is the path to the resulting document in GitHub Markdown. Note If you don't see output from the above command quickly, it means that Pandoc is having an issue with a specific section of the document. Stop the command (or docker container), find and temporarily remove the offending section, convert the remainder of the document with Pandoc, and manually convert the offending section. Previewing your document(s) with Mkdocs \u00b6 Mkdocs has a development mode that can be used to preview documents as you work on them and is available via package manager or pip . Once installed , add your document(s) to the pages section of mkdocs.yml and launch the mkdocs server with the following command from the dir containing mkdocs.yml : $ PYTHONPATH = src/ mkdocs serve Access the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and navigate to the document you're working on. It's useful to open the original TWiki doc in an adjacent tab or window to quickly compare the two. Completing the conversion \u00b6 Manual review of the automatically converted documents are required since the automatic conversion process isn't perfect. This section contains a list of problems commonly encountered in automatically converted documents. Visit the style guide to ensure that the document meets all style guidelines. Archiving Documents \u00b6 If the document is slated for archival (check if it says \"yes\" in the \"archived\" column of the spreadsheet), just download the document to the archive folder of your local git repository: user@host $ cd technology/ user@host $ curl '<TWIKI URL>?raw=text' | iconv -f windows-1252 > archive/<TWIKI TITLE> Where <TWIKI URL> is the link to the TWiki document that you want to download and <TWIKI TITLE> is the name that will receive the archived file For example: user@host $ cd technology user@host $ curl 'https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance?raw=text' | iconv -f windows-1252 > archive/SHA2Compliance After downloading the document, continue onto the next section to walk through pull request submission. Submitting the pull request \u00b6 Stage the archived raw TWiki (as well as the converted Markdown document(s) and mkdocs.yml if you are converting the document): user@host $ git add mkdocs.yml archive/<TWIKI ARCHIVE> <PATH TO CONVERTED DOC> Where <TWIKI ARCHIVE> is the name of the archived document and <PATH TO CONVERTED DOC> is the path to the .md file Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repo: user@host $ git commit -m \"<COMMIT MSG>\" user@host $ git push origin <BRANCH NAME> Change <COMMIT MSG> for a meaningful text that describes the conversion done and <BRANCH NAME> with the name chosen in the 3rd step of the Preparing the git repository section Open your browser and navigate to your GitHub fork Submit a pull request containing with the following body: <LINK TO TWIKI DOCUMENT> - [ ] Enter date into \"Migrated\" column of google sheet An example of <LINK TO TWIKI DOCUMENT> is: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SoftwareDevelopmentProcess If you are migrating a document, also add this task: - [ ] Add migration header to TWiki document If you are archiving a document, add this task: - [ ] Move TWiki document to the trash See an example pull request here . After the pull request \u00b6 After the pull request is merged, replace the contents of TWiki document with the div if you're migrating the document, linking to the location of the migrated document: <div style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em; background-color: #FFDDDD; font-weight: 600;\"> This document has been migrated to !GitHub (<LINK TO GITHUB DOCUMENT>). If you wish to see the old TWiki document, use the TWiki history below. Background: At the end of year (2017), the TWiki will be retired in favor of !GitHub. You can find the various TWiki webs and their new !GitHub locations listed below: * Release3: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/docs ([[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/tree/master/archive][archive]]) * !SoftwareTeam: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/technology ([[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/technology/tree/master/archive][archive]]) </div> If you are archiving a document, move it to the trash instead. Once the document has been updated or trashed, add the date to the spreadsheet and go back to your pull request and mark your tasks as complete. For example, if you completed the migration of a document: - [X] Enter date into \"Migrated\" column of google sheet - [X] Add migration div to TWiki document Currently, we do not recommend changing backlinks (links on other twiki pages that refer to the Twiki page you are migrating) to point at the new GitHub URL. This is to provide a simple reminder to users that the migration will occur, and also is likely low priority regardless as all pages will eventually migrate to GitHub. This advice may change in the future as we gain experience with this transition. Reviewing pull requests \u00b6 To review pull requests, cd into the dir containing your git repository and check out the requester's branch, which the twiki-converter container should automatically notice. Here's an example checking out Brian's cut-sw-release branch of the technology repository: # Add the requester 's repo as a remote if you haven' t already user@host $ git remote add blin https://www.github.com/brianhlin/technology.git user@host $ git fetch --all user@host $ git checkout blin/cut-sw-release Refresh your browser and navigate to the document in the request.","title":"Migrating Documents to Markdown"},{"location":"documentation/markdown-migration/#migrating-to-markdown","text":"As part of the TWiki retirement (the read-only target date of Oct 1, 2017, with a shutdown date in 2018), we will need to convert the OSG Software and Release3 docs from TWiki syntax to Markdown .

Check the box marked Initialize this repository with a README Once created, add the mkdocs topic by clicking on the \"Add topics\" button Clone the repository and cd into the directory: git clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/<ITB REPO NAME> cd <ITB REPO NAME> Create a gh-pages branch in the GitHub repository: git push origin main:gh-pages Update the contents of README.md In the non-ITB repository, create and encrypt the ITB repository deploy key cd into the non-ITB repository and generate the ITB deploy key cd <REPO NAME> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"help@osg-htc.org\" -f deploy-itb Install the travis gem: gem install travis Encrypt the deploy key: travis encrypt-file deploy-itb Update .travis.env with the appropriate ITB values Add and commit your files: git add .travis.env deploy-itb.enc git commit -m \"Add ITB deployment\" Danger Do NOT commit the unencrypted deploy-itb ! Add deploy-itb.pub to the ITB repository's list of deploy keys . Make sure to check Allow write access . Still in the non-ITB repository, push your local changes to the GitHub repository git push origin main Your documents should be shortly available at https://www.opensciencegrid.org/<REPO NAME> Transitioning to GitHub Actions \u00b6 Need assistance? If you need any assistance with transitioning your repository to GitHub actions, please reach out to help@osg-htc.org . When originally developed, OSG MkDocs repositories were set up to automatically publish web page changes through Travis CI . But in November 2020, Travis CI changed their pricing model so we are moving the automatic publishing infrastructure to GitHub Actions and using this opportunity to also upgrade the version of MkDocs. To ensure that your pages continue to be autmoatically published you will need to prepare your repository for the new version of MkDocs, disable Travis CI, and enable GitHub Actions. Preparing the repository \u00b6 Before upgrading, you must fix the following incompatibilities: Rename the pages: section of mkdocs.yml to nav: . The section contents are identical; only the name is changing. Update all of the links in the documents as follows: Ensure links end in .md Ensure links are document-relative, not site-relative For example, links should be of the form ../software/development-process.md instead of /software/development-process . Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request Previewing your pages with Docker If you would like to ensure the correctness of your fixes, run the following command: docker run -it -v ${PWD}/docs -p 8000:8000 squidfunk/mkdocs-material:6.1.4 After running this command, enter localhost:8000 in your browser to preview your pages. Saved changes made to .md files are automatically updated in your browser! Disabling Travis CI \u00b6 After you've prepared your repository for the transition, disable Travis CI by removing related files from it. Perform the following actions from the command-line: Create a fresh clone of the repository that is still using Travis CI: git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/<GIT REPOSITORY> Important For the rest of the steps in this documentation to work, you should create a new clone of the repository using the above command, even if you already have an existing copy! cd into the directory containing the repository (should be the same as <GIT REPOSITORY> by default) Remove all of the Travs CI related files: git rm ci git rm .travis.env deploy-key.enc .travis.yml Commit your changes: git commit -am \"Disable Travis CI\" Push your changes (you will be prompted for your GitHub credentials): git push origin master Enabling GitHub Actions \u00b6 The new method for validating and publishing OSG pages for a MkDocs repository can be enabled entirely through the GitHub web interface : Navigate to the opensciencegrid fork of the GitHub repository in your web browser, e.g. https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/ Click on the Actions tab: Find the Publish MkDocs static HTML workflow by the Open Science Grid and click the Set up this workflow button: Click on the Start commit drop-down button then click Commit new file : Navigate to the Actions tab to verify your transition.

Meta \u00b6 Run a spellchecker to catch any obvious spelling mistakes. Use official capitalizations when referring to titles (i.e., HTTPS, HTCondor) Start each new sentence on a new line. Lines should not exceed 120 characters, except in the case of link text , but may be split at earlier points (e.g. punctuation). Headings \u00b6 Use the following conventions for headings: The title should be the only level 1 heading Level 1 headings should use the ==== format Level 2 headings should use the ---- format Use APA-style title case for level 1 and level 2 headings. Only capitalize the first word for all other headings. Other heading levels should use the appropriate number of # Go no deeper than of level 5 headings Spin-off a new document or re-organize the existing document if you find that you regularly need level 5 headings. Links \u00b6 Only use document relative links in MkDocs 1.0.0 and newer MkDocs 1.0.0 does not support site-relative links (e.g. /software/development-process.md ). You must use document-relative links (e.g. ../software/development-process.md ) instead. Earlier versions of this guide recommended site-relative links; these only worked in earlier versions of MkDocs. Document-relative links work in all versions of MkDocs. Please convert any site-relative links to document-relative links before updating the doc-ci-scripts submodule to use MkDocs 1.0.0+. Links to internal pages must have the .md extension. (Earlier versions of this guide said links should not have the .md extension, but adding the .md extension is required for MkDocs 1.0.0+. Links with the .md extension work in all versions of MkDocs.) Links to the area's homepage (e.g. https://osg-htc.org/technology/) need to be of the form [link text](/) Links to other areas (like from https://osg-htc.org/technology/ to https://osg-htc.org/operations/) need to be absolute links (i.e. include the domain name) Section links \u00b6 To link sections within a page, lowercase the entire section name and replace spaces with dashes. If there are multiple sections with the same name you can link the subsequent sections by appending _N where N is the section's ordinal number minus one, e.g. append _1 for the second section. For example, if you have three sections named \"Optional Configuration\", link them like so: [1st section](#optional-configuration) [2nd section](#optional-configuration_1) [3rd section](#optional-configuration_2) Command blocks and file snippets \u00b6 Command blocks and file snippets outside of lists should be wrapped in three back-ticks (```) followed by an optional code highlighting format: ```console # stuff ``` Command blocks and file snippets inside of a list should use the appropriate number of spaces before three colons followed by an optional code highlighting format: # stuff See the lists section for details on properly formatting command blocks within a list. We use the Pygments highlighting library for syntax; it knows about 100 different languages. The Pygments website contains a live renderer if you want to see how your text will come out. Please use the console language for shell sessions. Root and user prompts \u00b6 When specifying instructions for the command-line, indicate to users whether the commands can be run as root ( root@host # ) or as an unprivileged user ( user@host $ ). For example: root@host # useradd -m osguser root@host # su - osguser user@host $ whoami osguser It can provide helpful context to use a more specific hostname in the prompt than host . For example, if you're writing a doc for setting up a Storage Element and a command is run as root on the SE, use root@se # . Or if you're testing the SE from the client side and the command is run as a normal user on a client, use user@client $ . Highlighting user input \u00b6 Use descriptive, all-caps text wrapped in angle brackets to to highlight areas that users would have to insert text specific to their site, e.g. <REMOTE SSH HOSTNAME> . The same text should be cited verbatim in surrounding prose with further explanation with examples of appropriate values. For additional visual highlighting, use hl_lines=\"N\" , where N can indicate multiple line numbers: ```console hl_lines=\"1 3\" root@condor-ce # yum install htcondor-ce # this is a comment root@condor-ce # condor_ce_trace -d <CE HOSTNAME> ```` Similarly, you may also specify :::console hl_lines=\"N\" for indented command blocks, replacing console with any language supported by Pygments . The above block is rendered below: root@condor-ce # yum install htcondor-ce # this is a comment root@condor-ce # condor_ce_trace -d <CE HOSTNAME> Lists \u00b6 When constructing lists, use the following guidelines: Use 1. for each item in a numbered list To make sure the contents of code blocks, file snippets, and subsequent paragraphs are indented properly, use the following formatting: For code blocks or file snippets, add an empty line after any regular text, then insert (N+1)*4 spaces at the beginning of each line, where N is the level of the item in the list. To apply code highlighting, start the code block with :::<FORMAT> ; see this page for details, including possible highlighting formats. For an example of formatting a code section inside a list, see the release series document . For additional text (i.e. after a code block), insert N*4 spaces at the beginning of each line, where N is the level of the item in the list. For example: 1. Foo - Bar :::console COMMAND BLOCK text associated with Bar text associated with Foo 1. Baz FILE SNIPPET There are 12 spaces and 8 spaces in front of the command block and text associated with Bar , respectively; 4 spaces in front of the text associated with Foo ; and 8 spaces in front of the file snippet associated with Baz . The above block is rendered below: Foo Bar COMMAND BLOCK text associated with Bar text associated with Foo Baz FILE SNIPPET Notes \u00b6 To catch the user's attention for important items or pitfalls, we used %NOTE% TWiki macros, these can be replaced with admonition-style notes and warnings: !!! note things to note or !!! warning if a user doesn't do this thing, bad stuff will happen The above blocks are rendered below as an example.

To contribute content , submit a pull request to the relevant GitHub repository, which are tagged with \"mkdocs\". List of documentation repos This document contains instructions, recommendations, and guidelines for writing OSG content. Contributing Content \u00b6 To contribute minor content changes (e.g., fixing typos, changing a couple of sentences), we recommend using the GitHub web interface to submit a pull request. To contribute major content changes to one of the above OSG areas, make sure you and the machine you'll be working on meet the following requirements: Have a Github account Installations of the following tools: Docker git Preparing the git repository \u00b6 Before making any content changes, you will need to prepare a local git clone: Fork and clone the GitHub repository that you'd like to contribute to Add the upstream Github repository as a remote . For example, if you are working on the User School 2018 pages: $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/opensciencegrid/user-school-2018 Previewing the pages \u00b6 To preview the pages, start a MkDocs development server. The development server will automatically detect any content changes and make them viewable in your browser. cd into the directory containing the local clone of your GitHub fork Start a MkDocs development server to preview your changes: $ docker run --rm -p 8000 :8000 -v ${ PWD } :/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material:7.1.0 To preview your changes visit localhost:8000 in the browser of your choice. The server can be stopped with Ctrl-C . Making content changes \u00b6 To contribute content to the OSG, follow these steps to submit a pull request with your desired changes: cd into the directory containing the local clone of your Github fork Create a branch based on a branch from the upstream repository: $ git fetch --all $ git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME> upstream/<UPSTREAM BRANCH NAME> Replace <BRANCH NAME> with a name of your choice and <UPSTREAM BRANCH NAME> with a branch name from the upstream repository. For example, instructors for the 2018 User School should use the materials branch: $ git checkout -b example_branch_name upstream/materials If you do not know which upstream branch to use, pick master . Make your changes in the docs/ directory of your local clone, following the style guide : If you are making changes to an existing page: Open mkdocs.yml and find the location of the file relative to the docs/ directory Make your changes to that file and move onto the next step If you are contributing a new page: Name the page. Page file names should be lowercase, - delimited, and concise but descriptive, e.g. markdown-migration.md or cutting-release.md Place the page in the relevant sub-folder of the docs/ directory. If you are unsure of the appropriate location, note that in the description of the pull request. Add the document to the nav: section of mkdocs.yml in APA-style title case , e.g. - Migrating Documents to Markdown: 'software/markdown-migration.md' Note If mkdocs.yml contains does not contain a nav: section, add the above to the pages: section instead. This means that the repository is using an older version of MkDocs and will need to be transitioned to GitHub Actions . If you are writing site administrator documentation, following the suggested document layout If you haven't already, start a Mkdocs development server to preview your changes . Continue making changes until you are satisfied with the preview, then stage your changes in git: $ git add <YOUR FILE> <YOUR 2nd FILE>...<YOUR Nth FILE> Where <YOUR * FILE> is any file that contains changes that you'd wish to make. If you are adding a new page, one of the files should be mkdocs.yml . Commit your changes and push them to your Github fork: $ git commit -m \"<DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGE>\" $ git push origin Where <DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGE> is a meaningful short text that identifies the changes applied, it is a good practice, to concatenate the ticket number associated e.g. \"Removing color macros (SOFTWARE-3739)\" From your Github fork, submit a pull request Document Layout \u00b6 This section contains suggested layouts of externally-facing, site administrator documentation . The introduction is the only layout requirement for documents except for installation guides. Introductions \u00b6 All documents should start with an introduction that explains what the document contains, what the product does, and why someone may want to use it. In the past, document introductions were included in About this... sections due to the layout of the table of contents. Since the table of contents is included in the sidebar this is unnecessary and introduction content should go directly below the title heading without any second-level headings. The HTCondor-CE installation guide is an example that meet all of the above criteria. Installation guides \u00b6 In addition to the introduction above, installation documents should have the following sections: Before Starting: This section should contain information for any prepatory work that the site administrator should do or consider before proceeding with the installation ( example ). Installation: Procedural instructions that tell the user how to install the software ( example ) Validation: How does the user make sure their installation is functional? Optionally, the following sections should be included as necessary. Overview: if the introduction becomes large and unwieldy, extract the details of what the product does into an overview section Configuration: required configuration steps ( example ) as well as a sub-section for optional configurations. For long optional configuration sections, consider creating alist of contents at the top of the sub-section ( example ). Troubleshooting: common issues that users encounter and their fixes Reference: Details about configuration and log files, unix users, certificates, networking, links to relevant upstream documentation, etc. ( example ) If any of the sections become too large, consider separating them out and linking to the new documents ( example ). Tips for Writing Procedural Instructions \u00b6 Title the procedure with the user goal, usually starting with a gerund; e.g.: Installing the Frobnosticator Number all steps (as opposed to using bullets) List steps in order in which they are performed Each step should begin with a single-line instruction in plain English, in command form; e.g.: Make sure that the Frobnosticator configuration file is world-writable If the means of carrying out the instruction is unclear or complex, include clarification, ideally in the form of a working example; e.g.: chmod a+x /usr/share/frobnosticator/frob.conf Put clarifying information in separate paragraphs within the step Put critical information about the whole procedure in one or more paragraphs before the numbered steps Put supplemental information about the whole procedure in one or more paragraphs after the numbered steps Avoid pronouns when writing technical articles or documentation e.g., install foo rather than install it . Avoid superfluous statements like you will want , you want , you should e.g., install foo rather than you will want to install foo . Use the imperative form in step-by-step instructions, e.g. install package foo rather than the package foo should be installed","title":"Writing Documentation"},{"location":"documentation/writing-documentation/#writing-osg-documentation","text":"Many OSG pages are written in markdown , built using MkDocs , and served via GitHub Pages .

For example, instructors for the 2018 User School should use the materials branch: $ git checkout -b example_branch_name upstream/materials If you do not know which upstream branch to use, pick master . Make your changes in the docs/ directory of your local clone, following the style guide : If you are making changes to an existing page: Open mkdocs.yml and find the location of the file relative to the docs/ directory Make your changes to that file and move onto the next step If you are contributing a new page: Name the page. Page file names should be lowercase, - delimited, and concise but descriptive, e.g. markdown-migration.md or cutting-release.md Place the page in the relevant sub-folder of the docs/ directory. If you are unsure of the appropriate location, note that in the description of the pull request. Add the document to the nav: section of mkdocs.yml in APA-style title case , e.g. - Migrating Documents to Markdown: 'software/markdown-migration.md' Note If mkdocs.yml contains does not contain a nav: section, add the above to the pages: section instead. This means that the repository is using an older version of MkDocs and will need to be transitioned to GitHub Actions . If you are writing site administrator documentation, following the suggested document layout If you haven't already, start a Mkdocs development server to preview your changes . Continue making changes until you are satisfied with the preview, then stage your changes in git: $ git add <YOUR FILE> <YOUR 2nd FILE>...<YOUR Nth FILE> Where <YOUR * FILE> is any file that contains changes that you'd wish to make.

Commit your changes and push them to your Github fork: $ git commit -m \"<DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGE>\" $ git push origin Where <DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGE> is a meaningful short text that identifies the changes applied, it is a good practice, to concatenate the ticket number associated e.g. \"Removing color macros (SOFTWARE-3739)\" From your Github fork, submit a pull request","title":"Making content changes"},{"location":"documentation/writing-documentation/#document-layout","text":"This section contains suggested layouts of externally-facing, site administrator documentation .

The changes can be tested together. GSI/GridFTP migration AI (Edgar): test new GFAL client available in EPEL testing with XRootD 4 and 5 The new client works with XRootD 4; still cannot test on XRootD 5rc4. Edgar is in communication with Andy to debug and fix. Two problems with XRootD: HTTPS is not recognized as a plugin and the proxy is being rejected. AI (Edgar): Update a VO frontend to GlideinWMS 3.7 Edgar updated the JLab frontend to GlideinWMS 3.7-1. Seems stable but there are other, unrelated issues at JLab. AI (Carl): OASIS manager + COManage endpoint (SOFTWARE-3947) Some back and forth with Dave Dykstra, who is experiencing authorization issues. Since the data is public, it's possible that the authorization check can be dropped. Should check that it causes no privacy issues (for example).

The stashcp RPM in progress for OSG is binary-only because Go 1.16 is not available in EPEL 7. Dave Dykstra mentioned trying to get the EPEL version of Go updated; if he is successful, we can revisit the packaging.","title":"Discussion"},{"location":"meetings/2022/TechArea20220125/#support-update","text":"ASU (BrianL): Investigate no pilot hours due to too many open FDs while running Gratia BNL (Mat): Debugging authentication issues with XRootD.

Working on fix for slowdown when launching processes for running RRD commands; Python RRD is the only method which gives acceptable performance but there is no RPM for the dependency. Marco will discuss with OSG Software team how to handle the dependency issue. Support Update \u00b6 BNL (BrianL): Qiulan/Doug say that WebDAV doesn't work for their standalone server Edinburgh (BrianL): help register a cache and sort out Dune data federation details OU (Derek): Issues with tier2-01.ochep.ou.edu gratia, Horst indicated it's an EL6 cluster and he would be in favor of turning it off. SDSC (Mat): Got their cache working by using OSG 3.5; asked Diego/Fabio to upgrade some of our test caches to OSG 3.6 so we can figure out auth issues without breaking his site. OSG DevOps \u00b6 StashCP multi-file download/upload. Secured an \"Open Source\" license for Gitpod which is the Professional level. It's a competitor to Github Codespaces. Remote development.

Thin pool improvements are being tested on CHTC. Planning on releasing 9.0.17 this week. Putting finishing touches on 10.0.0; mostly bringing UW spec file in sync with OSG.

Investigating general credential support improvements. The factory would like to supply a list of credentials for a CE with fallback from one to the other (instead of using only one credential that has to be listed per-entry). Discussion \u00b6 Kernel issues in CHTC being investigated; most likely a kernel bug being triggered by having many condor_procds (one for each Glidein). Not worth holding up the release for. EL9 coming - transition tasks likely to be assigned to Carl. Support Update \u00b6 BrianL (PATh Facility): Helping users that have previously had XSEDE credentials log in to the Facility.

Discussion \u00b6 Tim will release HTCondor-CE 6 which works with HTCondor 10 this week; HTCondor 10.3.0 expected next week Group write permissions for the PATh origin are broken due to xrootd-multiuser not having the right group permission to traverse the directory tree to enter into private directories. A potential workaround is to make the parent directories world-traverseable but not world-readable. We would have to remind users that they need to make their files not world-readable and also investigate what permissions xrootd gives newly written files. A long term solution is to modify xrootd-multiuser to set the process's supplementary groups before accessing files in group directories.

A potential workaround is to make the parent directories world-traverseable but not world-readable. We would have to remind users that they need to make their files not world-readable and also investigate what permissions xrootd gives newly written files. A long term solution is to modify xrootd-multiuser to set the process's supplementary groups before accessing files in group directories.","title":"Discussion"},{"location":"meetings/2023/TechArea20230214/#support-update","text":"None this week","title":"Support Update"},{"location":"meetings/2023/TechArea20230214/#osg-release-team","text":"Ready for Testing htvault-config 1.14 Add auditlog option to move the audit log to a different location Ready for Release Nothing yet","title":"OSG Release Team"},{"location":"meetings/2023/TechArea20230214/#discussion_1","text":"None this week","title":"Discussion"},{"location":"meetings/2023/TechArea20230221/","text":"OSG Technology Area Meeting, 21 February 2023 \u00b6 Coordinates: Conference: +1-415-655-0002, PIN: 146 266 9392, https://morgridge-org.zoom.us/j/91987518094 (password sent separately) Attending: BrianL, Marco, Mat, TimT Announcements \u00b6 Triage Duty \u00b6 This week: Mat Next week: TimT 8 (+1) open FreshDesk tickets 0 (+0) open GGUS ticket Jira (as of Monday) \u00b6 # of tickets \u0394 State 220 +2 Open 37 -3 Selected for Dev 27 +1 In Progress 10 -7 Dev Complete 10 +2 Ready for Testing 0 +0 Ready for Release OSG Software Team \u00b6 Kubernetes Hackathon Plan osdf-origin chart pipeline Implement automatic deployment re-roll in the origin chart (https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#automatically-roll-deployments) Pick CHTC LDAP replica static IP EL 9 AI (BrianL): rebuild osg-ce without Squid dependency AI (BrianL): build voms for EL9 AI (Mat): XRootD mapfile + Topology status?

In the past, this type of access was provided through X.509 proxies with VOMS attributes to demonstrate assocation with a collaboration: Users (both human and robots) would request that their collaboration sign their X.509 proxies (usually through a VOMS server), Or in the case of automated services (i.e. pilot job submission) a collaboration could directly create and sign proxies themselves Now, sites can authenticate and authorize clients presenting bearer tokens, such as SciTokens or WLCG tokens. This document describes how collaborations can issue bearer tokens for the aforementioned use cases in ways that are compatible with OSG sites. Issuers \u00b6 To generate bearer tokens, a collaboration must adminster at least one \"token issuer\" to issue tokens to their users. In addition to generating and signing tokens, token issuers provide a public endpoint that can be used to validate an issued token, e.g. an OSG Compute Entrypoint (CE) will contact the token issuer to authorize a bearer token used for pilot job submission. Token issuer uptime Due to the centralized nature of bearer token validation, token issuers should be treated as critical, highly available services. Otherwise, a token issuer outage will result in OSG sites being unable to authenticate a collaboration's tokens, meaning an interruption in pilot job submission and authenticated data transfers. Choose one of the token issuer types below, depending on the needs of your collaboration. Simple issuer \u00b6 If your collaboration centrally administers all services requiring bearer tokens and your users do not need to directly manage bearer tokens, consider running a simple token issuer. A simple token issuer consists of a public/private certificate keypair where the private key is used to issue tokens directly and the public certificate is made available through a web server. For example, the OSPool (n\u00e9e OSG VO) serves its public certificate through GitHub pages and uses the private key to sign tokens used for pilot job submission as well as automatically generating tokens to accompany user jobs so that they can access their private storage areas. OAuth2/OpenID Connect \u00b6 If your collaboration distributes administrative responsibility or your users need to request and manage their own tokens, you should administer an OAuth2/OpenID Connect (OIDC) service (e.g., INDIGO IAM ) or work with an existing OAuth2/OIDC provider (e.g., CILogon ). For example, Fermilab uses CILogon as their OIDC provider combined with an HTVault server used to streamline the OIDC process for users and integrate with their local Kerberos. Claims \u00b6 Bearer tokens are self-describing credentials that enumerate their capabilities as \"claims\" and different token \"profiles\" enumerate common sets of claims. OSG sites support the following bearer token profiles: SciTokens WLCG tokens Claims are further described below with recommendations to ensure the greatest compatibility with OSG sites. Scope \u00b6 The scope claim is a space-separated list of authorizations that should be granted to the bearer. Scopes utilized by OSG services include the following: Capability SciTokens scope WLCG scope HTCondor READ condor:/READ compute.read HTCondor WRITE condor:/WRITE compute.modify compute.cancel compute.create XRootD read read:<PATH> storage.read:<PATH> XRootD write write:<PATH> storage.modify:<PATH> Replacing <PATH> with a path to the storage location that the bearer should be authorized to access. Issuer \u00b6 The issuer URL, or the iss claim, indicates the endpoint to use for authenticating a given token. A collaboration may have more than one token issuer but a single token issuer should never serve more than one collaboration. In other words, given the token issuer, the site can determine the collaboration that issued the token. The following collaborations have registered token issuers with the OSG: Collaboration Issuers ATLAS https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/ATLAS.yaml CLAS12 https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/CLAS12.yaml CMS https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/CMS.yaml DES https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/DES.yaml DUNE https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/DUNE.yaml EIC https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/EIC.yaml Fermilab https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/Fermilab.yaml CHTC (n\u00e9e GLOW) https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/GLOW.yaml Gluex https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/Gluex.yaml IceCube https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/IceCube.yaml LIGO https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/LIGO.yaml Mu2e https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/Mu2e.yaml OSPool https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/OSG.yaml SBND https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/SBND.yaml gm2 https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/gm2.yaml The OSG distributes the osg-scitokens-mapfile RPM package that includes issuer and subject to default user mappings for use by OSG CEs. Subject \u00b6 Subjects (i.e., the sub claim) should be unique, stable identifiers that correspond to a user or service (e.g. pilot job submission). In other words, subjects combined with a token issuer can be used for suspending access for a given collaboration user, user-level accounting, monitoring, auditing, or tracing. In tandem with a token issuer URL (i.e., the iss claim), subjects can be used by site HTCondor-CE or XRootD services to map to a local identity. Privacy considerations Depending on your collaboration's userbase and contributing sites, you may have to take privacy concerns, such as the GDPR into account when assigning subjects to users. Thus, it may be preferable to assign users a randomly-generated string as their sub . Audience \u00b6 To take advantage of the improved security posture of bearer tokens, we recommend that the aud claim be set to the intended host. For example, tokens used for submission to an HTCondor-CE should set the following: aud = <CE FQDN>:<CE PORT> WLCG groups \u00b6 WLCG tokens may have the wlcg.groups claim consisting of a comma and space separated list of collaboration groups. The format of these groups are similar to VOMS FQANs: /<collaboration>[/<group>][/Role=<role>] , replacing <collaboration> , <group> , and <role> with the collaboration, group, and role, respectively, where the group and role are optional. For example, the following groups and roles have been used by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations: /atlas/ /atlas/usatlas /cms/Role=pilot /cms/local/Role=pilot Traditionally, sites have made local accounting and scheduling decisions based on the first VOMS FQAN so collaborations should set the first group/role in wlcg.groups to the most specific group or role.

It aims to help external repositories and OSG VOs understand what OSG is attempting to achieve with the mirroring service. This is not a service-level agreement but rather a statement of responsibilities. Note To actually understand the technical procedure for mirroring a repository, see the following page . This document solely covers the policy aspects. Introduction \u00b6 The OSG provides a network of CVMFS Stratum-1 servers for mirroring content of externally-managed repositories. These repositories are often hosted by large HEP or physics VOs for the purpose of distributing software for high-throughput computing jobs. Additionally, OSG provides a repository ( ) for smaller VOs; this is not covered here. OSG will include additional repositories into the content distribution network (CDN) at the request of an OSG-affiliated VO. These repositories are meant to help the OSG-affiliated VO accomplish their domain science. The goal of this mirroring provides an improved quality-of-service for the VO end-users running at OSG sites. OSG does not provide support for use of the software in external repositories, but will help end-users contact the VO for help as necessary. OSG Responsibilities \u00b6 OSG will provide the Stratum-1 server network according to the OASIS SLA OSG will provide a best-effort mirror of the full contents of the external repo. We will attempt to provide best-effort integrity of the object contents, but assume users of the Stratum-1 will do further integrity checking. No SLA is provided covering potential data corruptions. OSG will provide best-effort notification to the mirrored repository in case OSG detects a service outage of the external repo. In the event of a security incident, the operations group will replace the compromised repository with an empty directory, signed by the key managed by them. This will be done in consultation with the security team or, in the unlikely event they cannot be reached, at the discretion of the Operations Coordinator. Once the external repository is approved, OSG will distribute the corresponding repository signing keys in a valid whitelist. The whitelist will be signed by the OSG Stratum-0. This whitelist attests to the authenticity of the key, but not a statement about repository contents. VO Responsibilities \u00b6 The individual responsible on behalf of the VO will be registered with the OASIS Manager role in OIM. The requesting VO should only include targeted repositories they need to support their science. The VO should understand that in the event of a reported security incident, the contents of this repository may be replaced with an empty directory and signed by the OSG repository key. Depending on the OSG Security team's evaluation of the severity and urgency of the incident, the blanking may be done immediately without VO notification or after some notification period. In the case of a security incident, the VO and OSG Security team will need to mutually agree that the incident is resolved before the repository is unblanked. The VO is ultimately responsible for the contents of the repository. OSG provides a mirror. If the external repository is not operated by the VO, OSG may work directly with the external repository maintainers. This is done for ease of operations and may be limited to day-to-day, non-security-related support. Operational Policies \u00b6 To help us provide the best operational setup possible, we have a few additional replication policies: OSG Operations only hosts the shared oasis.opensciencegrid.org repository; VO-dedicated software respositories (such as nova.opensciencegrid.org for the NoVA VO) should be operated by the VO. VOs are asked to either run their own repository or utilize the shared repository, but not both. There is a finite amount of high-performance storage on the CDN. A minimum of 100 GB per repository is guaranteed. Larger limits may be requested. VOs may ask the OSG to replicate their repositories to the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI); however, this can only be done if the repository name ends in .opensciencegrid.org .","title":"OASIS Repository Mirroring"},{"location":"policy/external-oasis-repos/#policy-for-osg-mirroring-of-external-cvmfs-repositories","text":"12 October 2017 This document provides an overview of the policies and security understanding with regards to OSG mirroring of CVMFS repositories of external organizations.

This schedule had been in place since early 2013. Since then, conditions within and outside of the Software team have changed, and we have adjusted the release schedule and associated processes. The previous release model had the recurring problem of a \"release crunch,\" where it was difficult to find the effort required to test large changes before their deadline had passed. Sometimes the lack of timely effort led to software being pushed to the next release (a month later), because there was insufficient testing time. Based on software support tickets, we noticed that many sites follow a local update schedule that is independent of the OSG Release team schedule; some sites upgrade every few months, skipping interim releases, other sites upgrade individual packages as needed. In addition, upstream software developers do not follow our release schedule either, releasing software on their own development timelines. As a result, some site administrators would prefer to have OSG software updates more often, closer to when they become available, rather than tied to a monthly cycle. For these reasons, we created a new release model.

In both cases, approaches are becoming increasingly niche; as they have not become widely adopted - indeed, as the communities dramatically shrink while the Internet ecosystem grows - the support costs are increasingly directly shouldered by the OSG. For example, we currently use the GridFTP and GSI implementations in the Grid Community Toolkit (GCT). While the OSG contributes to the GCT (a fork of the abandoned Globus Toolkit) to sustain operations, the long-term plan is to migrate our community off these approaches. The end of the Globus Toolkit is a stark reminder of how niche the current ecosystem is: even the original reference implementation was abandoned. Thus, OSG has the opportunity and motivation to evolve toward a data transfer protocol and security techniques that better fit our needs and allow us to connect to more vibrant software communities. For the data transfer, we are proposing HTTP; for the AAI, we are proposing the use of bearer tokens, HTTPS, and OAuth2. The production-oriented nature of the OSG \u2014 and the embedding of OSG-LHC in the WLCG community \u2014 means that careful coordination, communication, and planning are needed whenever we migrate away from production services. OSG has executed several such technology transitions before and managing the full software lifecycle is part of our value to stakeholders. This document proposes affected services, replacement technologies, and rough timelines for a transition. Timeline \u00b6 The following table contains the major milestones and deliverables for the entire transition. Detailed migration plans can be found in this document . Date Milestone or Deliverable Completed Aug 2019 Beginning of OSG 3.5 release series (last release series depending on GCT) \u2705 Aug 2019 Including HTCondor 8.9.2 in the \u2018upcoming\u2019 repository (first HTCondor version with SciTokens support). \u2705 Oct 2019 OSG no longer carries OSG-specific patches for the GCT. All patches are upstreamed or retired. \u2705 Mar 2020 \"GSI free\" site demo. Show, at proof-of-concept / prototype level, all components without use of GCT. \u2705 Sep 2020 All GCT-free components are in OSG-Upcoming. \u2705 Feb 2021 OSG series 3.6, without GCT dependencies, is released. \u2705 1 May 2022 End of support for OSG 3.5. \u2705 Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 How does SciTokens interoperate with other token technologies in the WLCG? \u00b6 The scitokens-cpp library used by OSG can transparently use both WLCG JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and SciTokens. Will a US-LHC migration from GridFTP to XRootD require the same migration for WLCG? \u00b6 No but we have been working to ensure that we coordinate our activities through the WLCG DOMA group. What role does LCMAPS play with SciTokens? \u00b6 LCMAPS only works with GSI. The model for SciTokens is sufficiently more simple for sites that the full complexity of LCMAPS is not needed. What does a SciTokens transition for GlideinWMS mean for European sites? \u00b6 The only piece that involves European sites is the factory to CE relationship: given HTCondor-CE 4.0 already supports SciTokens, we have begun to engage with the ARC-CE team. What are the T1s going to do? No SRM? How does tape work with XRootD and HTTPS? \u00b6 Note that CTA, which CERN is planning to transition to this year, only has XRootD support. We don't think there's a clear HTTPS picture here (or a clear dCache picture for SRM-free) so there will need to be coordination with other groups (e.g. the QoS working group). Can WLCG-FTS handle both SciTokens and x509 certificates at the same time? \u00b6 Yes. Can PhEDEx handle SciTokens? \u00b6 Yes.

Introduction \u00b6 GUMS (Grid User Management System) is an authentication system used by OSG resource providers to map grid credentials to local UNIX accounts. It provides OSG site adminstrators with a centrally managed service that can handle requests from multiple hosts that require authentication e.g., HTCondor-CE, GridFTP, and XRootD servers. In discussion with the OSG community, we have found that sites use the following GUMS features: Mapping based on VOMS attributes Host-based mappings Banning users/VOs Supporting pool accounts GUMS is a large Java web application that is more complex than necessary for the subset of features used in the OSG. Additionally, upstream support has tailed off and as a result, the maintenance burden has largely fallen on the OSG Software team. OSG's plans to retire GUMS has two major components: Find a suitable replacement for GUMS Provide documentation, tooling, and support to aid in the transition from GUMS to the intended solution Site Transition Plans \u00b6 We have released a configuration of the LCMAPS authorization framework that performs distributed verification of VOMS extensions. This configuration, referred to as the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, supports VOMS attribute based mappings as well as user and VO banning. Host-based mappings are not supported however, the simplicity of the plugin's installation and the distributed verification of VOMS extensions makes this feature unnecessary. Pool accounts are not supported by the plugin but this feature will be addressed in an upcoming transition-specific document. The intended solution will revolve around mapping local user accounts via user grid mapfile and we will work with any site for which this solution does not work. LCMAPS VOMS plugin installation and configuration documentation can be found here (formerly: lcmaps-voms-authentication).

For details regarding the technical process for an OSG release, see this document . Yum Repositories \u00b6 The Software Team maintains the following Yum repositories: osg-development : This is the \"wild west\", the place where software goes while it is being worked on by the software team. osg-testing : This is where software goes when it is ready for wide-spread testing, including upstream release candidates osg-prerelease : This is where software goes just before being released, for final verification. osg-release : This is the official, production release of the software stack. This is the main repository for end-users. osg-contrib : This is where software goes that is not officially supported by the OSG Software Team, but we provide as a convenience for software our users might find useful. Occasionally there may be other repositories for specific short-term purposes. Note osg-rolling and osg-release-VERSION are only present in the OSG 3.5 series. osg-rolling : This is where software goes before being included in a point release. Intended for end-users. In OSG 3.5, software goes into osg-rolling when it is put into osg-prerelease . osg-release-VERSION : This repository is created per release and its name contains the version number (e.g. osg-release-3.5.4). This is intended mostly for testing purposes, though users may occasionally find it useful. Version Numbers \u00b6 OSG 3.6+ \u00b6 The version number matches the release series. OSG 3.5 \u00b6 There is a single version number that is used to summarize the contents of the osg-release repository. Having a single version number is very useful for a variety of reasons, including: Every time changes are made to the osg-release repository, we update the version number and write release notes. We have a shorthand for referring to the state of the repository; we can talk about specific releases. However, there are important caveats about the version number: Even if a user says they have installed Version X, it may not be an accurate reflection of what they have installed: they may have chosen to update some of their software from a previous version. To truly understand what they have installed, the entire set of RPMs installed on their computer must be considered. The version number is only meaningful in the osg-release repository, though for technical reasons it's present (as an RPM) in other repositories. The version number is communicated as follows: Every time a new release is made, the version number is updated. All release notes and communication to users about this release uses the new version number. The version number will be of the form X.Y.Z. As of this writing, version numbers are 3.5.Z, where Z indicates a minor revision. Progression of Repositories \u00b6 This figure shows the progression of repositories that packages will go through: osg-development -> osg-testing -> osg-prerelease / osg-rolling -> osg-release \\ -> osg-contrib Release Policies \u00b6 Adding packages to osg-development \u00b6 New packages will only be added to osg-development with the permission of the OSG Software Manager. Updates can be done at any time without permission, but developers should be careful if their updates might be significant, particularly if an update might cause series compatibility issues. In cases where there is uncertainty, discuss it with the Software Manager. Moving packages to osg-testing \u00b6 A package may be moved from osg-development to osg-testing when the individual maintainer of that package decides that it is ready for widespread testing and when approved by the OSG Software Manager. Approval is needed because this is when we first make packages available to people outside of the OSG Software Team. Moving packages to osg-prerelease; Readying the release \u00b6 When we are ready to make a production release, we first move the correct subset of packages from osg-testing into osg-prerelease . This should be done after checking with the OSG Release Manager to verify that it's okay to release the software. The intention of osg-prerelease is to do a final verification that we have the correct set of packages for release and that they really work together. This is important because the osg-testing repository might contain a mix of packages that are ready for release with packages that are not ready for release. When moving packages to osg-prerelease , the team member doing the release will: Find the correct set of packages to push from osg-testing into osg-prerelease . At a minimum, run the automated test suite on the contents of osg-prerelease . In cases were more extensive testing is needed, or the test suite doesn't sufficiently cover the testing needs, do specific ad-hoc testing. (If appropriate, consider proposing extensions to the automated test suite.) We expect that in most cases, this process of updating and testing the osg-prerelease repository will be less than one day. If there are urgent security updates to release, this process may be shortened. Moving packages to osg-release \u00b6 When the osg-prerelease repository has been updated and verified, all of the changed software can be moved into the osg-release repository. As part of this move, three important tasks must be done: The released packages are automatically recorded in such a manner that end users/administrators can be notified if desired. Major package updates will also be recorded on the OSG 3.6 \"News\" page with links to the respective release note page or change log. An announcement is sent out whenever a major package is updated. Moving packages to osg-contrib \u00b6 The osg-contrib repository is loosely regulated. In most cases, the team member in charge of the package can decide when a package is updated in osg-contrib . Contrib packages should be tested in osg-development first. Timing of releases \u00b6 Software is released between 9AM and 5PM Central Time on a work day that is followed by a work day. The idea is to have a working day to correct any problems with a release rather than having a problematic release persist over a weekend or holiday. We will make exceptions for urgent situations; consult with the release manager when needed. CA Certificates and VO Client packages \u00b6 Packages that contain only data are not part of the usual release cycle. Currently, these are the CA certificate packages and the VO Client packages. Updates to these packages come from the Security Team and Software Team, respectively. They still move through the usual process for release, and the Software and Release Managers decide when these packages should be promoted to the next repository level.","title":"Software Release Policy"},{"location":"policy/software-release/#software-release-policy","text":"This document contains information about the OSG Software Yum repositories and their policies.

Considerations \u00b6 When providing support for our users, remember the following: We are a small community and we need to take good care of our users. Please be friendly and patient even when the user is frustrated or lacking in knowledge. Always sign your ticket with your full name, so people know who is responding. If it's easy for you, include a signature at the bottom of your response. If you need to collect information about a problematic host, ask users to run osg-system-profiler . It can shorten the number of times you ask for information because it collects quite a bit for you. If you run across a problem that has a chance of being hit by other users: Is there a bug we should fix in the software? Open a Jira ticket. Is there something we could improve in the software? Notify the Software Area Coordinator. Is there a way to improve our documentation? Notify the Software Area Coordinator. Can you extend our troubleshooting documents to help people track this down more quickly? Consider the troubleshooting documents to be as much for us as for our users. Is this something that other Technology Team members should be aware of? Note it during the support discussion during the weekly OSG Technology meeting, or email the Technology Team if it seems more urgent. Triage Duty \u00b6 The OSG uses Freshdesk to track support issues so you will need a Freshworks account with agent privileges (contact the OSG Software Team Area Coordinator for access). Logging in as an agent Don't enter your credentials directly into the login page ! Click the agent login link instead so that you don't have to enter your credentials twice. During normal work hours, the OSG Technology Team splits responsibilities for managing incoming OSG Software support requests based upon a weekly rotation . If you are on triage duty, your responsibilities are as follows: Watch for new software tickets: review the Unresolved Software Tickets and All Unassigned Tickets filters at least three times daily for new OSG Software-related tickets. For any such unassigned tickets, assign it as follows: If you can handle an incoming ticket, assign it to yourself. Inasmuch as possible, you should strive to handle the easier tickets and not pass them off to other people. If you cannot handle an incoming ticket, collect initial details such as relevant versions, logs, etc., and assign the ticket to the most appropriate Technology Team member. Where appropriate, CC third-parties or add relevant OSG staff with FD accounts as watchers (see this documentation ) New sites interested in joining the OSG For support requests inquiring about joining the OSG, assign the ticket to the Campus Services group. Review assigned software tickets. For tickets that are not being handled in a timely fashion (pay special attention to OVERDUE and Customer Responded tickets): If the ticket is pending and the assignee has not responded in > 2 business days, notify the ticket assignee via private note that they need to revisit the ticket. If the ticket is waiting on the customer or a third party and they have not responded in > 1 week, reply to the ticket asking if they've had the time to review the Technology Team's latest response(s). If the ticket was opened by the customer, is waiting on the customer and they have not responded in > 2 weeks, close the ticket and let the customer know that they can re-open it by responding whenever they're ready to tackle the issue again. Review and approve/deny COManage site contact registrations: Follow the instructions to review site contact registrations here . Review Topology data pull requests: Review any Topology PRs that update anything in the collaborations , projects/ , topology/ , or virtual-organizations directories. New institutions Approval of new facilities or project institutions require PATh Project Office, i.e. Irene or Janet. Re-assign non-software tickets: Tickets that have been mistakenly assigned to the Software group should be re-assigned to the appropriate group. Merge duplicate tickets: Responses to a ticket sometimes results in creation of a new ticket; these new tickets should be merged into the original ticket. See this documentation . Split off new support requests in old tickets: If a user has reopened or followed-up in a ticket with a new support request unrelated to the existing ticket (this is a judgment call) and their comment is the last one in the ticket, split off the comment into a new ticket (see this documentation ). If you are unsure if a ticket should be split, consult the Software Area Coordinator. Do not split comments other than the last one FD treats splitting tickets as \"take this comment and make it the start of a new ticket\" and not \"take this comment and all subsequent comments into a new ticket\". Clean up spam: Mark the ticket as spam and block the user. See this documentation . Clean up automated replies: announcements are often sent with Reply-to: help@osg-htc.org so automated replies (e.g. Out of Office, mailing list moderation) will generate tickets.

If someone emails you directly for support, you have the choice of when to move it to a ticket. The recommended criteria are: If it's easy to handle and you can definitely do it yourself, leave it in email. If there's a chance that you can't do it in a timely fashion, turn it into a ticket.

Freshdesk \u00b6 Freshdesk access The OSG uses Freshdesk to track support issues so you will need a Freshworks account with agent privileges (contact the OSG Software Team Manager for access). Freshdesk tickets are for user support, i.e. this is where we help users debug, understand their problems, etc. When replying to or otherwise updating a Freshdesk ticket, there are a few things to note: Freshdesk auto-populates the contact's name when replying through the web interface, e.g. Hi Brian .

Support for the VOMS infrastructure has three major components: VOMS-Admin : A web interface for maintaining the list of authorized users in a VO and their various authorizations (group membership, roles, attributes, etc). VOMS-Server : A TCP service which signs a cryptographic extension on an X509 proxy certificate asserting the authorizations available to the authenticated user. VOMS Client : Software for extracting and validating the signed VOMS extension from an X509 proxy. The validation is meant to be distributed: the VOMS client does not need to contact the VOMS-Admin server. However, OSG has historically used software such as GUMS or edg-mkgridmap to cache a list of authorizations from the VOMS-Admin interface, creating a dependency between VOMS client and VOMS-Admin. VOMS-Admin is a large, complex Java web application. Over the last few years, upstream support has tailed off - particularly as OSG has been unable to update to VOMS-Admin version 3. As a result, the maintenance burden has largely fallen on the OSG Software team. Given that VOMS-Admin is deeply tied to X509 security infrastructure - and is maintenance-only from OSG Software - there is no path forward to eliminate the use of X509 certificates in the web browser, a high-priority goal In discussions with the OSG community, we have found very few VOs utilize VOMS-Admin to manage their VO users. Instead, the majority use VOMS-Admin to whitelist a pilot certificate: this can be done without a VOMS-Admin endpoint. OSG's plans to retire VOMS-Admin has three major components: (Sites) Enable distributed validation of VOMS extensions in the VOMS client. (VOs) Migrate VOs that use VOMS only for pilot certificates to direct signing of VOMS proxies. (VOs) Migrate remaining VOs to a central comanage instance for managing user authorizations; maintain a plugin to enable direct callouts from VOMS-Server to comanage for authorization lookups. Site Transition Plans \u00b6 We will release a configuration of the LCMAPS authorization framework that performs distributed verification of VOMS extensions; this verification eludes the need to contact the VOMS-Admin interface for a list of authorizations. In 2015/2016, LCMAPS and GUMS were upgraded so GUMS skips the VOMS-Admin lookup when LCMAPS asserts the validation was performed. Hence, when GUMS sites update clients to the latest (April 2017) LCMAPS and HTCondor-CE releases, the callout to VOMS-Admin is no longer needed. Note : In parallel to the VOMS-Admin transition, OSG Software plans to retire GUMS . There is no need to complete one transition before the other. Sites using edg-mkgridmap will need to use its replacement, lcmaps-plugins-voms (this process is documented here ). VO Transition Plans \u00b6 Based on one-to-one discussions, we believe the majority of VOs only use VOMS-Admin to maintain a list of authorized pilots. For these VOs, we will help convert invocations of voms-proxy-init : voms-proxy-init -voms hcc:/hcc/Role=pilot to an equivalent call to voms-proxy-fake : voms-proxy-fake -hostcert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\ -hostkey /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem \\ -fqan /hcc/Role=pilot/Capability=NULL \\ -voms hcc -uri hcc-voms.unl.edu:15000 The latter command would typically be run on the VO's glideinWMS frontend host, requiring the service certificate currently on the VOMS-Admin server to be kept on the frontend host. The frontend's account may also need access to the certificate. Info See this documentation to update your GlideinWMS Frontend to use the new proxy generation command. We plan to transition more complex VOs - those using VOMS-Admin to track membership in a VO - to comanage . It is not clear there are any such VOs that need support from OSG. If there are, a hosted version of comanage is expected to be available in summer 2017 from the CILogon 2.0 project. If you feel your VO is affected, please contact the OSG and we will build a custom timeline. If there are no such VOs, we will not need to adopt comanage for this use case (other uses of comanage are expected to proceed regardless). Timeline \u00b6 April 2017 (completed): lcmaps-plugins-voms shipped and supported by OSG. May 2017 (completed): osg-configure and documentation necessary for using lcmaps-plugins-voms is shipped.

HTCondor-CE Collector (WIP) \u00b6 The CE Collector is a stripped-down version of HTCondor-CE that contains mostly just the collector daemon and configs. It was introduced in htcondor-ce-1.6. The production CE Collectors run at the GOC, but you may want to set up your own for testing. Make 2 VMs with the EPEL/OSG repos installed: one for the collector, and one for the CE Setting Up the Collector \u00b6 Install htcondor-ce-collector Create a file called /etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf that contains this line: COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD = $(COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD), your_htcondor_ce_host.example.net</pre> (with your_htcondor_ce_host replaced by the hostname the HTCondor-CE VM) Run service condor-ce-collector start Setting Up the CE \u00b6 Install osg-htcondor-ce-condor (replace condor with the batch system of your choice) Ensure osg-configure >= 1.0.60-2 is installed Configure your CE using osg-configure You should use the HTCondor-CE Install Docs as a reference, although you can skip several of the steps You can skip setting up Squid: set enabled to True and location to UNAVAILABLE in 01-squid.ini Set htcondor_gateway_enabled to True in 10-gateway.ini You probably don't need GUMS, but if you want it, use the Fermi GUMS server (set gums_host to gums.fnal.gov and authorization_method to xacml in 10-misc.ini) To keep osg-configure from complaining about storage, edit 10-storage.ini : Set se_available to False Set app_dir to /osg/app_dir Set data_dir to /osg/data_dir Do mkdir -p /osg/app_dir/etc; mkdir -p /osg/data_dir; chmod 1777 /osg/app_dir{,/etc} Enable your batch system by setting enabled to True in 20-<batch system>.ini Set up the site info in 40-siteinfo.ini ; in particular, you'll need to set the resource and resource_group settings \\ (you just need to pick a name; I concatenate my login name with the short host name and use that, e.g. matyasfermicloud001). \\ You can also use the following settings: group=OSG-ITB sponsor=local city=Batavia, IL country=US longitude=-88 latitude=41 Edit the file /etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini and set ce_collectors to the collector host Run osg-configure -dc Start up your batch system Run service condor-ce start The CE will report to the collector host every five minutes. If you want to force it to send now, run condor_ce_reconfig . You should see your CE if you run condor_ce_status -schedd on the collector host. RSV \u00b6 Testing a fresh installation: make sure the yum repositories required by OSG is installed on your host rpm -Uvh http://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.6/osg-3.6-el8-release-latest.rpm OR rpm -Uvh http://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.6/osg-3.6-el7-release-latest.rpm also make sure epel repo is set up. install the rpm yum --enablerepo=osg-testing install rsv edit /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini file in my case, I don't have a service cert for testing, so I use my own personal cert to create the proxy, but later on the owner of the proxy should be changed to \"rsv\" user that is created during the rpm install. in the config file, for the ce_hosts and gridftp_hosts, put in a test server, as the result from this test will be uploaded to OSG GOC, which may mess up your production service monitoring if you chose a production server for the test. osg-configure -v osg-configure -c /etc/init.d/condor-cron start /etc/init.d/rsv start rsv-control --list rsv-control --version rsv-control --run --all-enabled 11. make sure the results from the above commands look fine. Testing an upgrade installation: make sure to enable the osg-testing repo, and set its priority higher than the other repos yum --enablerepo=osg-testing upgrade rsv* you can use the old 30-rsv.ini file for configuration repeat steps 4)~11) as mentioned in the last section. Slurm \u00b6 This section goes through the steps needed to set up a slurm install on a VM. This is a necessary prerequisite for testing Slurm related components (CE integration, gratia, etc.). Note that the slurm setup used for this uses weak passwords for mysql. It should be sufficient for a quick setup, testing, and then tear down but should not be used without changes if it will be running for any appreciable length of time. Note need to have a VM with 2+ GB of memory Installation and setup \u00b6 Download scripts and config files: cd /tmp/ git clone <https://github.com/sthapa/utilities.git> cd utilities/slurm setup and install slurm components export username='USERNAME' \\# user that jobs will run as export version='14.11.7' \\# slurm version to install (e.g. 16.05.2 or 14.11.7) ./slurm-setup.sh After successful completion, slurm and slurm gratia probes should be setup and enabled. Running a job using slurm \u00b6 Generate test.sh with the following: #/bin/bash echo \"In the directory: `pwd`\" echo \"As the user: `whoami`\" echo \u201cHostname:\" /bin/hostname sleep 60 </pre> run sbatch test.sh the output from the jobs should appear in the current working directory as test.sh.[eo].nnnnn where nnnnn is a job id VO Client \u00b6 This document contains a basic recipe for testing a VO Package release Prerequisites \u00b6 Testing the VO package requires a few components: * X.509 certificate with membership to at least one VO * System with working GUMS installation * System with OSG installation (voms-proxy-init and edg-mkgridmap) Testing voms-proxy-init \u00b6 Login in the system that has voms-proxy-init installed. Make sure that you have the correct vo-client rpms installed and that your X.509 certificate is in your home directory. For each VO that you have membership in, run the following voms-proxy-init -voms [VO] where [VO] is the appropriate VO (e.g. osg, cms, etc.). You should be able to generate a voms-proxy for that VO without errors. XRootD VOMS Testing \u00b6 This section is intended for OSG Software/Release teams to gather information on testing vomsxrd/xrootd-voms-plugin package. Original plugin named vomsxrd , similar to lcmaps that extracts information for authorization within xrootd of a proxy's voms extension. You need an xrootd server installation In the xrootd server yum install the following packages: xrootd xrootd-voms-plugin vo-client In the xrootd client yum install the following packages: xrootd-client voms-clients vo-client In the xrootd server add this lines to file /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg xrootd.seclib /usr/lib64/libXrdSec.so sec.protparm gsi -vomsfun:/usr/lib64/libXrdSecgsiVOMS.so -vomsfunparms:certfmt=raw|vos=cms|dbg -vomsat:2 sec.protocol /usr/lib64 gsi -ca:1 -crl:3 This configuration will only authorize members of VO cms . You can change it to another VO. Make sure fetch-crl has been run otherwise the xrootd service may fail to start.

If there are several tickets under a single umbrella ticket, adding the pre-release promotion table to just the parent ticket is sufficient. Once the pacakges have been promoted to pre-release, mark the Jira ticket \"Ready for Release\". Pick the Version Number \u00b6 The rest of this document makes references to <VERSION(S)> and <NON-UPCOMING VERSIONS(S)> , which refer to a space-delimited list of a date string plus the OSG version(s) and that same list minus the upcoming versions (e.g. 231130 3.6 3.6-upcoming 23 23-upcoming and 231130 3.6 23 ). Generally, the first number is the release date encoded as yymmdd . Also this document make references to <FULL VERSION(S)> , which refer to a space-delimited list of version numbers (e.g. 3.6.231130 23.231130 ). If you are unsure about either the version or revision, please consult the release manager. Day 0: Generate Preliminary Release List \u00b6 The release manager often needs a tentative list of packages to be released. This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release. Run 0-generate-pkg-list from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate: VERSIONS = '<VERSION(S)>' # laptop git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git cd release-tools ./0-generate-pkg-list $VERSIONS Day 1: Verify Pre-Release and Generate Tarballs \u00b6 This section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release and create the client tarballs. Step 1: Verify Pre-Release \u00b6 Compare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated release-list in git). To do this, run the 1-verify-prerelease script from git: VERSIONS = '<VERSION(S)>' # laptop ./1-verify-prerelease $VERSIONS If there are any discrepancies, consult the release manager. You may have to tag or untag packages with the osg-koji tool. Step 2: Test Pre-Release in VM Universe \u00b6 To test pre-release, you will be kicking off a manual VM universe test run from osg-sw-submit.chtc.wisc.edu . Ensure that you meet the pre-requisites for submitting VM universe test runs Prepare the test suite by running: osg-run-tests -P 'Testing OSG pre-release' cd into the directory specified in the output of the previous command Submit the DAG: ./master-run.sh Note Test upcoming even though nothing will be released into upcoming. It is possible that a blahp (or some other) update in 3.X could affect upcoming. Note If there are failures, consult the release-manager before proceeding. Step 3: Regenerate the build repositories \u00b6 To avoid 404 errors when retrieving packages, it's necessary to regenerate the build repositories. Run the following script from a machine with your koji-registered user certificate: NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS = \"<NON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)>\" # laptop ./1-regen-repos $NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS Step 4: Create the client tarballs \u00b6 Create the OSG client tarballs on dumbo using the relevant script from git: FULL_VERSIONS = \"<FULL VERSION(S)>\" # dumbo.chtc.wisc.edu git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tarball-client.git cd tarball-client for ver in $FULL_VERSIONS ; do ./docker-make-client-tarball --version $ver --all done The tarballs are found in the tarball-client directory. Step 5: Briefly test the client tarballs \u00b6 Test the OSG client tarballs in Docker containers on dumbo using the relevant release-tools script: As an unprivileged user , run the script: NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS = \"<NON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)>\" # dumbo.chtc.wisc.edu ./1-verify-tarballs $NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS If you have time, try some of the binaries, such as grid-proxy-init. Step 6: Wait \u00b6 Wait for clearance. The OSG Release Coordinator (in consultation with the Software Team and any testers) need to sign off on the update before it is released. If you are releasing things over two days, this is a good place to stop for the day. Day 2: Pushing the Release \u00b6 Step 1: Upload the tarballs to AFS \u00b6 On dumbo , upload the tarballs to AFS. (This step moved to release day, since repo.opensciencegrid.org tarballs are automatically updated hourly from the VDT web site served out of AFS.) NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS = \"<NON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)>\" # dumbo.chtc.wisc.edu ./2-upload-tarballs-to-afs $NON_UPCOMING_VERSIONS Step 2: Push from pre-release to release \u00b6 This script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos, locks the repos and regenerates them. VERSIONS = '<VERSION(S)>' # laptop 2 -push-release $VERSIONS Step 3: Update the Release Information \u00b6 This script updates the release information in AFS. VERSIONS = '<VERSION(S)>' # laptop 2 -update-info $VERSIONS *.txt files are created and it should be verified that they've been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW's AFS. Step 4: Rebuild the Docker software base \u00b6 Go to the build-docker-image workflow page of the opensciencegrid/docker-software-base : https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-software-base/actions/workflows/build-container.yml Click the Run Workflow button, select the master branch, and click Run workflow . Step 5: Install the tarballs into OASIS \u00b6 Note You must be an OASIS manager of the mis VO to do these steps. Known managers as of 2014-07-22: Mat, Tim C, Tim T, Brian L. Get the uploader script from Git and run it with osgrun from the UW AFS install of the tarball client you made earlier. On a UW CSL machine: FULL_VERSIONS = \"<FULL VERSION(S)>\" # dumbo.chtc.wisc.edu git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tarball-client.git cd tarball-client for ver in $FULL_VERSIONS ; do ./upload-tarballs-to-oasis $ver done The script will automatically ssh you to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org and give you instructions to complete the process. Step 6: Update the Docker WN client \u00b6 The GitHub repository at opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn controls the contents and tags pushed for the opensciencegrid/osg-wn container image. Navigate to the build/push workflow Click the Run workflow button and select the master branch Verify that all builds succeed Step 7: Verify the CA certificates update \u00b6 If this release contains either the osg-ca-certs package, verify that the CA web site has been updated. Wait for the CA certificates to be updated. It may take a while for the updates to reach the mirror used to update the web site. The repository is checked hourly for updated CA certificates. Once the web page is updated, run the following command to update the CA certificates in the tarball installation and verify that the version of the CA certificates match the version that was promoted to release. # moria.cs.wisc.edu /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel7/osgrun osg-update-data Step 8: Merge any pending documentation \u00b6 For each documentation ticket in this release, merge the pull requests mentioned in the description or comments. Step 9: Update News \u00b6 Make a new entry in the News section of the release series page. For the list of changes, make an entry for each package that contains short descriptive text that would inform a system administrator whether or not this change is of concern to them. Also, link in any release announcement web page that is available for the software. Look a prior releases of the same software for hints on where to find such a page. Examine the known issues and remove any that were resolved with this release. Of course, add any new ones that have come up. Spell check the news. Locally serve up the web pages and ensure that the formatting looks good and the links work as expected. docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material:7.1.0 Make a pull request, get it approved, and merged. When the web page is available, you can announce the release. Step 10: Announce the release \u00b6 The following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager). If you are not the release manager, let the release manager know that they can announce the release. The release manager writes the a release announcement for each version and sends it out. The announcement should mention a handful of the most important updates. Due to downstream formatting issues, each major change should end at column 76 or earlier. Here is a sample, replace <BRACKETED TEXT> with the appropriate values: Subject: Announcing OSG Software version <VERSION> We are pleased to announce OSG Software version <VERSION>! Changes to OSG <VERSION> include: - Major Change 1 - Major Change 2 - Major Change 3 Release notes and pointers to more documentation can be found at: https://osg-htc.org/docs/release/osg-36/#latest-news The OSG Docker images on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/u/opensciencegrid/) have been updated to contain the new software. Need help? Let us know: http://www.osg-htc.org/docs/common/help/ We welcome feedback on this release! The release manager uses the osg-notify tool on osg-sw-submit.chtc.wisc.edu to send the release announcement using the following command: $ osg-notify --cert your-cert.pem --key your-key.pem \\ --no-sign --type production --message <PATH TO MESSAGE FILE> \\ --subject '<EMAIL SUBJECT>' \\ --recipients \"osg-general@opensciencegrid.org osg-operations@opensciencegrid.org osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org software-discuss@osg-htc.org site-announce@opensciencegrid.org\" \\ --oim-recipients resources --oim-recipients vos --oim-contact-type administrative Replacing <EMAIL SUBJECT> with an appropriate subject for your announcement and <PATH TO MESSAGE FILE> with the path to the file containing your message in plain text. Final Steps \u00b6 On the Releases page, create version(s) that matches <FULL VERSION(S)> for this release. Open the OSG Ready for Release filter and release the tickets, setting the Resolution to Fixed and replacing the Fix versions with the specific full version(s) created above. For tickets that have version numbers in common, use the `Bulk change' functionality. Once all the tickets have been closed, go back to the Releases page and release the specific full versions.","title":"How to Cut a Release"},{"location":"release/cut-sw-release/#how-to-cut-a-software-release","text":"This document details the process for releasing new OSG Release version(s).

Prerequisites \u00b6 The following items are known prerequisites to using this recipe. If you are not running the Ansible commands from osghost, there are almost certainly other prerequisites that are not listed below. And even using osghost for Ansible and itb-submit for the submissions, there may be other prerequisites missing. Please improve this document by adding other prerequisites as they are identified! A checkout of the osgitb directory from our local git instance (not GitHub) Your X.509 DN in the osgitb/unmanaged/htcondor-ce/grid-mapfile file and (via Ansible) on itb-ce1 and itb-ce2 Gathering Information \u00b6 Technically skippable, this section is about checking on the state of the ITB machines before making changes. The plan is to keep the ITB machines generally up-to-date independently, so those steps are not listed here. And honestly, the steps below are just some ideas; do whatever makes sense for the given update. The commands can be run as-is from within the osgitb directory from git. Check OS versions for all current ITB hosts: ansible current -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'cat /etc/redhat-release' Check the date and time on all hosts (in case NTP stops working): ansible current -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'date' Check software versions for certain hosts (e.g., for the condor package on hosts in the workers group): ansible workers -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'rpm -q condor' Installing HTCondor Prerelease \u00b6 Use this section to install a new version of HTCondor, specifically a prerelease build from the development or upcoming-development repository, on the test hosts. Obtain the NVR of the HTCondor prerelease build from OSG to test. Do this by talking to Tim T. and checking Koji. Shut down HTCondor and HTCondor-CE on prerelease machines: ansible 'testing:&ces' -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor-ce state=stopped' ansible 'testing:&condor' -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor state=stopped' Install new version of HTCondor on prerelease machines: ansible 'testing:&condor' -i inventory -bK -f 10 -m command -a 'yum --enablerepo=osg-development --assumeyes update condor' or, if you need to install an NVR that is \u201cearlier\u201d (in the RPM sense) than what is currently installed: ansible 'testing:&condor' -i inventory -bK -f 10 -m command -a 'yum --enablerepo=osg-development --assumeyes downgrade condor condor-classads condor-python condor-procd blahp' Verify correct RPM versions across the site: ansible condor -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'rpm -q condor' Restart HTCondor and HTCondor-CE on prerelease machines: ansible 'testing:&condor' -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor state=started' ansible 'testing:&ces' -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor-ce state=started' Installing a Prerelease of the OSG Software Stack \u00b6 Use this section to install new versions of all OSG software from a prerelease repository in Yum. Check with the Release Manager to make sure that the prerelease repository has been populated with the desired package versions. Make sure that software is generally up-to-date on the hosts \u2014 see the Madison ITB Site doc for more details It may be desirable to update only non-OSG software at this stage, in which case one could simply disable the OSG repositories by adding command-line options to the yum update commands. Install new software on prerelease hosts: ansible testing -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m command -a 'yum --enablerepo=osg-prerelease --assumeyes update' Read the Yum output carefully, and follow up on any warnings, etc. If the osg-configure package was updated on any host(s), run the osg-configure command on the host(s): ansible testing -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m command -a 'osg-configure -v' -l [HOST(S)] ansible testing -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m command -a 'osg-configure -c' -l [HOST(S)] Verify OSG software updates by inspecting the Yum output carefully or examining specific package versions: ansible current -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'rpm -q osg-wn-client' Use an inventory group and package names that best fit the situation. Running Tests \u00b6 For the first two test workflows, use your personal space on itb-submit . Copy or checkout the osgitb/htcondor-tests directory to get the test directories. Part \u2160: Submitting jobs directly \u00b6 Change into the 1-direct-jobs subdirectory If there are old result files in the directory, remove them: make distclean Submit the test workflow condor_submit_dag test.dag Monitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck In the initial test runs, the entire workflow ran in a few minutes. If the DAG or jobs exit immediately, go on hold, or otherwise fail, then you have some troubleshooting to do! Keep trying steps 2 and 3 until you get a clean run (or one or more HTCondor bug tickets). Check the final output file: cat count-by-hostnames.txt You should see a reasonable distribution of jobs by hostname, keeping in mind the different number of cores per machine and the fact that HTCondor can and will reuse claims to process many jobs on a single host. Especially watch out for a case in which no jobs run on the newly updated hosts (at the time of writing: itb-data[456] ). (Optional) Clean up, using the make clean or make distclean commands. Use the clean target to remove intermediate result and log files generated by a workflow run but preserve the final output file; use the distclean target to remove all workflow-generated files (plus Emacs backup files). Part \u2161: Submitting jobs using HTCondor-C \u00b6 If direct submissions fail, there is probably no point to doing this step. Change into the 2-htcondor-c-jobs subdirectory If there are old result files in the directory, remove them: make distclean Get a proxy for your X.509 credentials voms-proxy-init Submit the test workflow condor_submit_dag test.dag Monitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck In the initial test runs, the entire workflow ran in 10 minutes or less; generally, this test takes longer than the direct submission test, because of the layers of indirection. Also, status updates from the CEs back to the submit host are infrequent. For direct information about the CEs, log in to itb-ce1 and itb-ce2 to check status; don\u2019t forget to check both condor_ce_q and condor_q on the CEs, probably in that order. If the DAG or jobs exit immediately, go on hold, or otherwise fail, then you have some troubleshooting to do! Keep trying steps 2 and 3 until you get a clean run (or one or more HTCondor bug tickets). Check the final output file: cat count-by-hostnames.txt Again, look for a reasonable distribution of jobs by hostname. (Optional) Clean up, using the make clean or make distclean commands. Part \u2162: Submitting jobs from a GlideinWMS VO Frontend \u00b6 For this workflow, use your personal space on glidein3.chtc.wisc.edu . Copy or checkout the osgitb/htcondor-tests directory to get the test directories. Again, if previous steps fail, do not bother with this step. Change into the 3-frontend-jobs subdirectory If there are old result files in the directory, remove them: make distclean Submit the test workflow condor_submit_dag test.dag Monitor the jobs until they are complete or stuck This workflow could take much longer than the first two, maybe an hour or so. Also, unless there are active glideins, it will take 10 minutes or longer for the first glideins to appear and start matching jobs. Thus it is helpful to monitor condor_q -totals until all of the jobs are submitted (there should be 2001), then switch to monitoring condor_status until glideins start appearing. After the first jobs start running and finishing, it is probably safe to ignore the rest of the run. If the jobs do not appear in the local queue, if glideins do not appear, or if jobs do not start running on the glideins, it is time to start troubleshooting. Check the final output file: cat count-by-hostnames.txt The distribution of jobs per execute node may be more skewed than in the first two workflows, due to the way in which pilots ramp up over time and how HTCondor allocates jobs to slots.

Remove the retired series from the OSG VMU tests. However, retain the upgrade test from the retired series to the current series. Remove any github actions that build software-base or osg-wn-client Docker images for the retired series. Previous Release Series Removal Plan \u00b6 In order to reduce clutter and disk usage on our repositories and build system, we will remove older OSG Software release series. This will result in packages from those series becoming unavailable, so we will remove a release series when its packages are no longer needed. We will remove a release series no earlier than when the following series is completely out of support. For example, OSG 3.1 will be removed when OSG 3.2 is out of support, and OSG 3.2 will be removed when OSG 3.3 is out of support. Tasks \u00b6 Removing a release series requires work from both Operations and Software & Release. The first step is to create a JIRA ticket in the SOFTWARE project to track the work. Second, Software & Release will enumerate the directories for Operations to remove. Operations tasks should be completed before Software & Release tasks. Operations \u00b6 These tasks should be completed in order. Two weeks in advance, notify sites (including mirror sites) that the release series is going away. See the template email below. Remove the series from the mash configs on the repo.opensciencegrid.org machines: Add the koji tags for the old series to the /usr/local/osg-tags.excluded file: # cd /usr/local # fgrep osg-3.1 osg-tags osg-3.1-el5-contrib osg-3.1-el5-development osg-3.1-el5-release osg-3.1-el5-testing osg-3.1-el6-contrib osg-3.1-el6-development osg-3.1-el6-release osg-3.1-el6-testing # fgrep osg-3.1 osg-tags >> osg-tags.exclude Re-run update_mashfiles.sh to update the mash config files: # ./update_mashfiles.sh Remove the appropriate repo directories from /usr/local/repo/osg . # rm -rf repo*/osg/3.1/ Reclaim space from any cached rpms in the mash cache which are no longer linked elsewhere: # find mash/cache/ -name \\* .rpm -type f -links 1 -delete Wait for mash to run and verify that the repos are no longer getting updated: Look at the mash logs in /var/log/repo . Verify that mash did not recreate the repo directory under /usr/local/repo/osg corresponding to the old release series. Remove tarballs from repo and OASIS Software & Release \u00b6 These tasks can be completed in any order. Tag and remove the SVN branch corresponding to the release series. Edit vm-test-runs and remove any \"long tail\" tests that reference the series. Edit tarball-client : Remove bundles from bundles.ini . Remove patch and other files that were used only by those bundles. Test that the current bundles didn't get broken by your changes. Edit osg-build : Remove the promotion routes from promoter.ini . Remove references in constants.py . Test your changes; also run the unit tests. Remove things from Koji: All targets referencing the series. All tags referencing the series. Remove references to the series from opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn on GitHub. Move files in /p/vdt/public/html/release-info to its attic subdirectory. Undoing \u00b6 If we really need RPMs from a removed release series, we can look at the text files in /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/attic to determine the exact NVRs we need, and download them from Koji. Template Email \u00b6 Subject: OSG 3.X packages will be removed from the repositories YYYY-MM-DD On <DAYNAME, MONTH DAY>, the OSG will be removing the OSG <3.X> release series from our repositories. This includes both RPMs and tarballs hosted on repo.opensciencegrid.org. As a reminder, support for OSG <3.X> ended after <MONTH YEAR>.

All examples are for testing an HTCondor-CE , but they should be applicable for other CE software. The focus of testing a CE is on the number of concurrent running jobs the CE can sustain as well as the ramp-up rate when many jobs are queued. Sleeper Pool \u00b6 With the focus on the CE, actual job payloads can be minimal \u2013 simple long sleep jobs are fine. Thus, then can run on nearly any resources, and it is even possible to allow far more of these jobs to run on a single resource than would be sensible for real jobs. When large-scale testing a CE, one of the objectives is to see if the CE can fully utilize all resources (cores) available to it or if there are bottlenecks preventing that outcome. However to do this would normally require using up production slots, and it is hard to find a site willing to give up so many production slots for so long. Thus, running resourceless jobs in parallel with production jobs allows the testing to proceed without interfering with real work. Setting Up a Sleeper Pool \u00b6 A sleeper pool is created by \u201ctricking\u201d a worker node into thinking it has more cores than physically available. Then, the host is configured so that jobs marked for the sleeper pool are routed to the extra slots. In HTCondor, this is done by changing the START expression on each startd. For example, on a 32-core machine: START = ( \\ (SlotID >= 1) && \\ (SlotID < 33) && \\ (RequiresWholeMachine =!= TRUE ) && \\ (SleepSlot =!= TRUE) && \\ (distro =?= \"RHEL6\" ) && \\ (CPU_Only == TRUE ) \\ ) || \\ ( (SlotID >= 33) && (distro =?= \"RHEL6\" ) && (SleepSlot == TRUE) ) Usual Topology of the Tests \u00b6 A brief introduction to the topology involved in the tests. Batch System and Sleeper Pool \u00b6 This is normally the batch system of the resources which will be behind the CE to be tested. It is normally set up by a site administrator. CE \u00b6 This is the physical hardware where the CE software runs, hopefully mimicking real production hardware specifications. Submitter \u00b6 An HTCondor submit host. It can be a virtual machine for most test submissions. Monitoring tools \u00b6 To monitor tests, two software components are needed (which can be installed on the same node): ganglia-gmond and ganglia-gmetad. Once they are installed, then some ad-hoc metrics can be created to monitor the CE; for example: condor_q -pool red.unl.edu:9619 -name sleeper@red.unl.edu -const 'JobStatus=?=2' | wc -l gmetric --name RunningJobsCE Generating Load \u00b6 Location \u00b6 The load_generators are found in the OSgscal github repo .

To do this, we use GitHub Actions to: Build new images on commits to master or main Update the docker-software-base on a schedule, which triggers builds for all image repos through repository dispatch Push container images to Docker Hub and the OSG Container Registry (Harbor) Code for new container images should now be stored in the GitHub repository opensciencegrid/images ; see below for instructions . The previous convention was to use individual GitHub repos for each image; these are described below . Add image code to the opensciencegrid/images repo \u00b6 The opensciencegrid/images repository is a central repository containing multiple container images based on the OSG Software Stack. The repository uses GitHub Actions CI to automatically build and push images, both on changes to individual images and upon updates to the upstream opensciencegrid/docker-software-base image. This repository is intended for images owned by OSG Staff with relatively simple CI needs: Images using OSG Yum repositories, especially those based on opensciencegrid/software-base Images that need tags based on the development , testing , and release tags for the supported OSG release series Images that push to Docker Hub and OSG Harbor Images that do not need CI tests See SOFTWARE-5013 for additional considerations. Creating new images from scratch \u00b6 Images are automatically built from the subdirectories of the opensciencegrid directory . A set of images will be built for each subdirectory, with each set containing multiple images based on OSG release series (e.g. 3.5 , 3.6 ) and release level (e.g. testing , release ). Fork and clone the https://github.com/opensciencegrid/images repo Create a subdirectory under opensciencegrid/ Create a README.md file describing the software provided by the image Create a LICENSE file containing the Apache 2.0 license text Create a Dockerfile building from the OSG Software Base image: ARG BASE_OSG_SERIES=3.6 ARG BASE_YUM_REPO=release FROM opensciencegrid/software-base:$BASE_OSG_SERIES-<DISTRO VERSION>-$BASE_YUM_REPO # Previous instance has gone out of scope ARG BASE_OSG_SERIES=3.6 ARG BASE_YUM_REPO=release LABEL maintainer OSG Software <help@osg-htc.org> RUN yum install -y <PACKAGE(S)> && \\ yum clean all && \\ rm -rf /var/cache/yum/* Replacing <DISTRO VERSION> with the Enterprise Linux version abbreviation (e.g., el7 , el8 ), and <PACKAGE(S)> with the RPM(s) you'd like to provide in this image. Hardcoding OSG series or release level If you do not want to build your image for all release series (for example, it's 3.6-only), or you do not want to build your image for all release levels (for example, always build from release), hardcode those instead of using the arguments, as in: ARG BASE_OSG_SERIES=3.6 FROM opensciencegrid/software-base:$BASE_OSG_SERIES-el8-release Adding an existing image from another repository \u00b6 If there is an existing source repository for an image that you would like to pull into the opensciencegrid/images central repository (e.g., images that make use of OSG Yum repositories), use the following instructions to retain history from the old repository. Install the git filter-repo plugin. For example, on an RPM-based operating system: yum install git-filter-repo Checkout opensciencegrid/images and your other source repository or make sure your local main branches are up-to-date cd to your other source repository and run the following: git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter opensciencegrid/<IMAGE NAME> cd to your local clone of the images repository and add your local repo as a remote using filesystem paths. For example: git remote add <IMAGE NAME> <PATH TO OTHER SOURCE REPO> In the images repo, create a branch based off of main for your work In the images repo, make sure your fork knows all the refs from the other source repo remote with the following: git fetch <IMAGE NAME> --tags While on your your new branch, do the merge. For example, if the main branch of your other source repository is main : git merge --allow-unrelated-histories <IMAGE NAME>/main Update the merged in Dockerfile to accept the BASE_OSG_SERIES and BASE_YUM_REPO arguments. Prepare the Docker Hub repository \u00b6 Ask the Software Manager to create a Docker Hub repo in the OSG organization. The name should generally match the subdirectory name under the images repo. Go to the permissions tab and give the robots and technology teams Read & Write access Old Image Repositories \u00b6 Some container images are stored in individual repositories under the opensciencegrid organization, with names prefixed with docker- and with the container repository topic. New images should not be created this way, but existing images may need to be updated or fixed; this section describes their layout and mechanics. Old image repos will have: A README.md file describing the software provided by the image A LICENSE file containing the Apache 2.0 license text A Dockerfile based off of the OSG Software Base image: FROM opensciencegrid/software-base:<OSG RELEASE SERIES>-<EL MAJOR VERSION>-release LABEL maintainer OSG Software <help@osg-htc.org> RUN yum update -y && \\ yum clean all && \\ rm -rf /var/cache/yum/* RUN yum install -y <PACKAGE> && \\ yum clean all && \\ rm -rf /var/cache/yum/* Replacing <PACKAGE> with the name of the RPM you'd like to provide in this container image, <OSG RELEASE SERIES> with the OSG release series version (e.g., 3.6 ), and <EL MAJOR VERSION> with the Enterprise Linux major version (e.g., 7 ).

Access to the following organizational secrets DOCKER_USERNAME DOCKER_PASSWORD OSG_HARBOR_ROBOT_USER OSG_HARBOR_ROBOT_PASSWORD The repo may also have access to the REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN organization secret, if it needs to send dispatches to another repository (e.g. docker-software-base ). A Docker Hub repository with a name matching the GitHub repo name, without the docker- prefix, with Read & Write access for the robots and technology teams. In addition, for repository dispatch from docker-software-base, they are listed in the GitHub Actions workflow for docker-software-base , in the dispatch-repo: list (under jobs: dispatch: strategy: matrix: ). Triggering Container Image Builds \u00b6 To build a new version of an existing container image , e.g. for a new RPM version of software in the container, you can kick off a new build in one of two ways: If there are no changes necessary to the container packaging: go to the GitHub repository's latest build under Actions, e.g. https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-frontier-squid/actions/ , and click \"Re-run jobs\" -> \"Re-run all jobs\". If changes need to be made to the container packaging: submit a pull request with your changes to the relevant GitHub repository and request that another team member review it. Once merged into master or main , a GitHub Actions build should start automatically. If the GitHub Actions build completes successfully, you should shortly see new fresh and timestamp tags appear in the DockerHub repository. Automatic weekly rebuilds If the repo's GitHub Actions are configured as above, container images will automatically rebuild, and therefore pick up new packages available in minefield once per week. Managing Tags in DockerHub \u00b6 Adding tags \u00b6 Images that have passed acceptance testing should be tagged as stable : Install the jq utility: yum install jq Get the sha256 repo digest of the image that the user has tested. All you need is the part that starts with sha256:... (aka the <DIGEST> ). A Kubernetes user can get the digest from the \"Image ID\" line obtained by running: kubectl describe pod <POD> A Docker user can get the digest by running: docker image inspect <IMAGE NAME>:<TAG> | jq '.[0].Id' (Optional) If you are tagging multiple images, you can enter your Docker Hub username and password into environment variables, to avoid having to re-type them.

The VO Client Package sources can be found here: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-vo-config When upstream changes have been made and are ready for a new VO Client Package release, these sources will be used to prepare a release tarball, which will in turn be used for the RPMs. In order to build the RPM, one needs: The tarball containing the: edg-mkgridmap.conf file gums.config.template file grid-vorolemap file (generated) voms-mapfile-default file (generated) vomses file vomsdir directory tree, containing the .lsc files. The RPM spec file, maintained in the OSG packaging area. JIRA Ticket for the Release \u00b6 There should be an associated JIRA ticket with a summary line of the form \"Release VO Package 85\". (Throughout this document, this release number will be referred to as <NN> .) The JIRA ticket should contain the details of the changes expected in the new VO Client Package release, which you should verify before proceeding. You can verify this with your favorite git tool (eg, git diff or gitk ), or just view the changes directly on GitHub: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-vo-config/compare/release-84...master Here, release-84 is the previous release tag, which you are comparing to the latest changes in master . To use GitHub to view the comparison, you need to specify whatever is the most recent previous release tag. Alternatively, you can proceed to make the tarball , and compare the result to the previous vo-client tarball (from the upstream source cache) before publishing the new release . However you choose to do it, the point is to verify that the changes going into the release match what is expected in the JIRA ticket before publishing a new release. Updates to the GUMS Template \u00b6 Most commonly, VO Client Package releases do not involve changes to the gums.config.template file, though on occasion it needs to be updated. Before proceeding, any changes to gums.config.template related to this release should be committed to git and pushed to the upstream repo on GitHub. The procedure for updating gums.config.template is outside the scope of this document, but the main important point is that any updates to this file should be done with the GUMS web interface rather than editing its xml contents by hand. Making the Tarball \u00b6 The process to make a new tarball has been mostly scripted. To make the tarball: Start with a clean checkout of the latest master branch of the osg-vo-config source repo . This checked out commit should be the one intended to be tagged for the new release. - Run the mk-vo-client-tarball script with the new release number <NN> : $ ./bin/mk-vo-client-tarball <NN> For example: $ ./bin/mk-vo-client-tarball 85 This will create a file vo-client-<NN>-osg.tar.gz in the current directory. Once the tarball is created: If you have not already verified the changes expected in the JIRA ticket, compare the contents of the new tarball with the previous version in the upstream source cache . Upload the tarball into the upstream source cache , under the vo-client/<NN>/ directory. RPM Spec File Maintenance \u00b6 The OSG RPM spec file is maintained in Subversion . The VO Client package is located in native/redhat/trunk/vo-client ; that is, here . There are two files that need to be maintained: osg/vo-client.spec The Version: field should be updated to match the <NN> number for the release A %changelog entry should be added for the new release, mentioning any changes and their associated tickets upstream/release_tarball.source Update the relative path for the new tarball within the upstream source cache . Typically this will be vo-client/<NN>/vo-client-<NN>-osg.tar.gz . RPM Building \u00b6 After installing the osg-build tools , check out a clean copy of the vo-client packaging directory from svn, then: osg-build prebuild . Once there are no errors, run osg-build koji . --scratch . (This can be done without making any permanent change.) Once that builds successfully, run osg-build koji . (This is permanent, unlike when you ran with --scratch .) You cannot rebuild this version of the RPM again; to rebuild with changes, you must bump the release number and edit the changelog. This will push the RPMs into the OSG development repository. Note Koji requires additional setup compared to rpmbuild; see the documentation here . Publishing the New Release \u00b6 The final version of the sources in the osg-vo-config , which was used to create the tarball that was used in the koji build, needs be tagged in git with a release-<NN> tag (eg, release-85 ) and published as a release on GitHub. You can create and push the release-<NN> from your git checkout of osg-vo-config , OR create the tag while publishing the release on GitHub (recommended). To publish the new release on GitHub: Go to https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-vo-config/releases/new In the \"Tag version\" field, enter release-<NN> (eg, release-85 ) If you are creating this tag on GitHub, click the \"Target\" dropdown button, and under the \"Recent Commits\" tab, make sure to select the commit you used when creating the tarball (It should be the first one) In the \"Release title\" field, enter <MONTH> <YEAR> VO Package Release <NN> (eg, December 2018 VO Package Release 85 ) In the release description, list the changes in this release and their associated ticket numbers, similar to the new %changelog entry added in the rpm spec file (You can view the releases page for examples) - Click the \"Publish release\" button Promotion to Testing and Release: \u00b6 Read Release Policy .

It is meant to be the central source for all development processes for the Software team. (But right now, it is just a starting point.) Overall Development Cycle \u00b6 For a typical update to an existing package, the overall development cycle is roughly as follows: Download the new upstream source (tarball, source RPM, checkout) into the UW AFS upstream area In a checkout of our packaging code , update the reference to the upstream file and, as needed, the RPM spec file Use osg-build to perform a scratch build of the updated package Verify that the build succeeded; if not, redo previous steps until success Optionally, lightly test the new RPM(s); if there are problems, redo previous steps until success Use osg-build to perform an official build of the updated package (which will go into the development repos) Perform standard developer testing of the new RPM(s) \u2014 see below for details Obtain permission from the Software Manager to promote the package Promote the package to testing \u2014 see below for details Versioning Guidelines \u00b6 OSG-owned software should contain three digits, X.Y.Z, where X represents the major version, Y the minor version, and Z the maintenance version. New releases of software should increment one of the major, minor, or maintenance according to the following guidelines: Major: Major new software, typically (but not limited to) full rewrites, new architectures, major new features; can certainly break backward compatibility (but should provide a smooth upgrade path). Worthy of introduction into Upcoming. Minor: Notable changes to the software, including significant feature changes, API changes, etc.; may break compatibility, but must provide an upgrade path from other versions within the same Major series. Maintenance: Bug fixes, minor feature tweaks, etc.; must not break compatibility with other versions within the same Major.Minor series. If you are unsure about which version number to increment in a software update, consult the Software Manager. Build Procedures \u00b6 Building packages for multiple OSG release series \u00b6 The OSG Software team supports multiple release series, independent but in parallel to a large degree. In many cases, a single package is the same across release series, and therefore we want to build the package once and share it among the series. The procedure below suggests a way to accomplish this task. Current definitions: maintenance: OSG 3.4 ( trunk ) current: OSG 3.5 ( branches/osg-3.5 ) Procedure: Make changes to trunk Optionally, make and test a scratch build from trunk Commit the changes Make an official build from trunk (e.g.: osg-build koji <PACKAGE> ) Perform the standard 4 tests for the current series (see below) Merge the relevant commits from trunk into the maintenance branch (see below for tips) Optionally, make and test a scratch build from the maintenance branch Commit the merge Make an official build from the maintenance branch (e.g.: osg-build koji --repo=3.4 <PACKAGE> ) Perform the standard 4 tests for the maintenance series (see below) As needed (or directed by the Software manager), perform the cross-series tests (see below) Note Do not change the RPM Release number in the maintenance branch before rebuilding; the %dist tag will differ automatically, and hence the maintenance and current NVRs will not conflict. Merging changes from one release series to another \u00b6 These instructions assume that you are merging from trunk to branches/osg-3.5 . They also assume that the current directory you are in is a checkout of branches/osg-3.5 . I will use $pkg to refer to the name of your package. First, you will need the commit numbers for your changes: svn log \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg | less Write down the commits you want to merge. If you only have one commit, merge that commit with -c as follows: svn merge -c $commit_num \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg Where $commit_num is the SVN revision number of that commit (e.g. 17000). Merging an individual change like this is referred to as \"cherry-picking\". If you have a range of commits and you wish to merge all commits within that range, then do the following: svn merge -r $start_num:$end_num \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg Where $start_num is the SVN revision of the commit BEFORE your first commit, and $end_num is the SVN revision of your last commit in that range. Note: Be very careful when merging a range from trunk into the maintenance branch so that you do not introduce more changes to the maintenance branch than are necessary. If you have multiple commits but they are not contiguous (i.e. there are commits made by you or someone else in that range that you do not want to merge), you will need to cherry-pick each individual commit. svn merge -c $commit1 \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg svn merge -c $commit2 \\^/native/redhat/trunk/$pkg $pkg ... Where $commit1 , $commit2 are the commit numbers of the individual changes. Note that merge tracking in recent versions of SVN (1.5 or newer) should prevent commits from accidentally being merged multiple times. You should still look out for conflicts and examine the changes via svn diff before committing the merge. Testing Procedures \u00b6 Before promoting a package to a testing repository, each build must be tested lightly from the development repos to make sure that it is not completely broken, thereby wasting time during acceptance testing. Normally, the person who builds a package performs the development testing. If you are not doing your own development testing for a package , contact the Software Manager and/or leave a comment in the associated ticket; otherwise, your package may never be promoted to testing and hence never released. The \"Standard 4\" tests, defined \u00b6 In most cases, the Software manager will ask a developer to perform the \u201cstandard 4\u201d tests on an updated package in a release series before promotion. This is a shorthand description for a standard set of 4 test runs: Fresh install on el6 Fresh install on el7 Update install on el6 Update install on el7 An \u201cupdate install\u201d is a fresh install of the relevant package (or better yet, metapackage that includes it) from the production repository , followed by an update to the new build from the development repository . For each test run, the amount of functional testing required will vary. For very simple changes, it may be sufficient to verify that each installation succeeds and that the expected files are in place For some changes, it may be sufficient to run osg-test on the resulting installation For some changes, it will be necessary to perform careful functional tests of the affected component(s) If you have questions, check with the Software Manager to determine the amount of testing that is required per test run. The \"Cross-Series\" test, defined \u00b6 The cross-series test may need to be run for packages that have been built for multiple release series of the OSG software stack (i.e. 3.4 and 3.5): On el7, install from the 3.4 repositories, then update from the 3.5 repositories Viewed another way, this test is similar to the update installs, above, except from 3.4-release to 3.5-development. The \"Long Tail\" tests, defined \u00b6 These tests may need to be run when updating a package that's also in the old, unsupported (3.3) branch. They will consist of: Install from 3.3-release and update to 3.5-development (on el7 only) The \"full set of tests\", defined \u00b6 All of the tests mentioned above. Running the tests in VM Universe \u00b6 In the case that the package you're testing is covered by osg-tested-internal, you can run the full set of tests in a manual VM universe test run. Make sure you meet the pre-requisites required to submit VM Universe jobs on osghost.chtc.wisc.edu . After that's done, prepare the test suite with a comment describing the test run. For example, if you were testing a new htcondor-ce package: osg-run-tests 'Testing htcondor-ce-3.2.1-1' After you cd into the directory specified in the output of the previous command, you will need to edit the *.yaml files in parameters.d to reflect the tests that you will want to run, i.e. clean installs, upgrade installs and upgrade installs between OSG versions. Once you're satisfied with your list of parameters, submit the dag: condor_submit_dag master-run.dag Promoting a Package to Testing \u00b6 Once development and development testing is complete, the final OSG Software step is to promote the package(s) to our testing repositories. After that, the Release team takes over with acceptance testing and ultimately release. Of course if they discover problems, the ticket(s) will be returned to OSG Software for further development, essentially restarting the development cycle. Preparing a Good Promotion Request \u00b6 Developers must obtain permission from the OSG Software manager to promote a package from development to testing. A promotion request goes into at least one affected JIRA ticket and will be answered there as well. Below are some tips for writing a good promotion request: Make sure that relevant information about goals, history, and resolution is in the associated ticket(s) Include globs for the NVRs to be promoted (or a detailed list, if it is that complicated, which it almost never is) If you ran automated tests: Link to the results page(s) Verify that relevant tests ran successfully (as opposed to being skipped or failing) \u2013 briefly summarize your findings Note whether the automated tests are just regression tests or actually test the current change(s) If there are any failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request If you ran manual tests: Summarize your tests and findings If there were failures, explain why they are not important to the promotion request If there are critical build dependencies that we typically check, include reports from the built-against-pkgs tool Note: This step is really just for known, specific cases, like the {HTCondor, BLAHP} set Occasionally, the OSG Software manager will request the tool to be run for other cases If other packages depend on the to-be-promoted package, explain whether the dependent packages must be rebuilt or, if not, why not For example (hypothetical promotion request for HTCondor-CE): May I promote htcondor-ce-2.3.4-2.osg3*.el* ? I ran a complete set of automated tests <LINK THE PRECEDING TEXT OR SEPARATELY HERE>; the HTCondor-CE tests ran and passed in all cases. There were some spurious failures of RSV in the All condition for RHEL 6, but this is a known failure case that is independent of HTCondor-CE. I also did a few spot checks manually (one VM each for SL 6 and SL 7), and in each case setting use_frobnosticator = true in the configuration resulted in the expected behavior as defined in the description field above. The built-against-pkgs tool shows that I built against all the latest HTCondor and BLAHP builds, see below. <JIRA-formatted table comes after> Promoting \u00b6 Follow these steps to request promotion, promote a package, and note the promotion in JIRA: Make sure the package update has at least one associated JIRA ticket; if there is no ticket, at least create one for releasing the package(s) Obtain permission to promote the package(s) from the Software Manager (see above) Use osg-promote to promote the package(s) from development to testing Comment on the associated JIRA ticket(s) with osg-promote's JIRA-formatted output (or at least the build NVRs) and, if you know, suggestions for acceptance testing Update the JIRA ticket description with a bulleted list describing changes in the promoted version(s) compared to the currently released version(s) Mark each associated JIRA ticket as \u201cReady For Testing\u201d","title":"Development Process"},{"location":"software/development-process/#software-development-process","text":"This page is for the OSG Software team and other contributors to the OSG software stack.

Basic Ideas \u00b6 At its simplest, we would like to understand how much effort is spent on various OSG Technology activities over time. The focus is on having reasonably accurate, unbiased data. We might use the data later, for example, to hone future OSG proposals. And of course, all federal funding is subject to effort tracking. There are just a few simple ideas to keep in mind: Each week, report your effort on OSG Technology activities Update your numbers in the effort tracking google spreadsheet (ask BrianL for access) and include a section in your weekly status report; here is an example: EFFORT External development: 63% Support: 12% Leave: 20% Outside: 5 Follow standard federal regulations for calculating effort (e.g., OMB Circular A-21) The main idea is that all of your job-related activity for a week equals 100%, whether that is exactly 40 hours of work, a little less (subject to your local institution\u2019s rules), or more. This implies that the same hours worked could result in different effort percentages reported from week to week; for example, 4 hours in a 40-hour week is 10%, but 4 hours in a 50-hour week (which I hope is exceedingly rare) is 8%. Report 100% of your effort each week, but note that all effort outside of the Technology area falls into a single category. Unless you work at UW\u2013Madison, we do not need to know any details about your effort outside of the Technology area. (BrianL will talk to UW\u2013Madison folks about local expectations.) If you are assigned to the Technology area for less than 100%, please report your actual Technology effort accurately. Workloads vary from week to week. For example, suppose you are 50% Technology in general, but you actually work 24 hours in a 40-hour week; you should report 60% effort for that week. The goal is to present reality, not what you think management wants to see. Effort is reported as integer percentages, no less accurate than 5% intervals So please do not report percentages like 43.21% and please do not round to the nearest 10%. Effort Categories \u00b6 Here are the categories in which to track effort: Investigations Work on the Investigations team External Software work that (generally) benefits our users; e.g., creating packages; updating existing ones; designing, coding, and testing new tools, existing tools, patches, or our software components Internal Software work on tools that we use to get work done; e.g., working on osg-test (for now), osg-build, Koji maintenance, the UW or UC ITB instances Documentation Work on our TWiki or Markdown documentation Release Release team activities, primarily acceptance testing and cutting releases Support User support, including working on GOC tickets, direct support emails, some JIRA tickets that are more support than development, etc. It might be tricky to decide when support work becomes development work; generally, once a support ticket turns into a JIRA ticket and goes through the normal development lifecycle, then the JIRA-based work is development. If there is still extensive communication with GOC ticket users, that is still support. Management This is mainly for team leads; e.g., managing team activities and tickets (generally); hiring; leading (not just attending) meetings Education Not for general learning or training activities The OSG Education area is essentially part of the Software area, because many technology-area members contribute to the OSG School.

If the meeting is more general (e.g., the weekly Monday meeting, or the OSG AHM), amortize your time according to your usual breakdown by category.

It is intended for people who wish to contribute to OSG software. Git and GitHub basics \u00b6 If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, the GitHub website has a good series of tutorials at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started Getting shell access to GitHub \u00b6 There are multiple ways of authenticating to GitHub from the shell. This section will cover using SSH keys. This is no longer the method recommended by GitHub, but is easier to set up for someone with existing SSH experience. The instructions here are derived from GitHub's own instructions on using SSH keys . Creating a new SSH key (optional but recommended) \u00b6 If you already have an SSH keypair in your ~/.ssh directory that you want to use for GitHub, you may skip this step. It is more secure, however, to create a new keypair specifically for use with GitHub. The instructions below will create an SSH public/private key pair with the private key stored in ~/.ssh/id_github and public key stored in ~/.ssh/id_github.pub . Generating the key \u00b6 Use ssh-keygen to generate the SSH keypair. For <EMAIL_ADDRESS> , use the email address associated with your GitHub account. [user@client ~ ] $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_github -C <EMAIL_ADDRESS> Configuring SSH to use the key for GitHub \u00b6 Make sure SSH uses the new key by default to access GitHub. Create or edit ~/.ssh/config and append the following lines: Host github.com IdentityFile <YOUR_HOME_DIR>/.ssh/id_github Where is the output of the command: echo $HOME Adding the SSH public key to GitHub \u00b6 Using the GitHub web interface: On the upper right of the screen, click on your profile picture In the menu that pops up, click \"Settings\" On the left-hand sidebar, click \"SSH and GPG keys\" In the top right of the \"SSH keys\" box, click \"New SSH key\" In the \"Title\" field of the dialog that pops up, enter a descriptive name for the key Open the public key file (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_github.pub (don't forget the .pub )) in a text editor and copy its full contents to the clipboard In the \"Key\" field, paste the public key Below the \"Key\" field, click \"Add SSH key\" You should see your new key in the \"SSH keys\" list. Testing that shell access works \u00b6 To verify you can authenticate to GitHub using SSH, SSH to git@github.com . You should see a message that 'you've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.' Contribution workflow \u00b6 We use the standard GitHub pull request workflow for making contributions to OSG software. If you've never contributed to this project on GitHub before, do the following steps first: Using the GitHub web interface, fork the repo you wish to contribute to. Make a clone of your forked repo on your local machine. [user@client ~ ] $ git clone git@github.com:<USERNAME/PROJECT> Where <USERNAME> is your github username and <PROJECT> is the name of the project you want to contribute to, e.g. in order to clone my local fork of the openscience/technology repository: [user@client ~ ] $ git clone https://github.com/ddavila0/technology.git Note If you get a \"Permission denied\" error, your public key may not be set up with GitHub -- please see the \"Getting shell access to GitHub\" section above. If you get some other error, the GitHub page on SSH may contain useful information on troubleshooting. Once you have your local repo, do the following: Create a branch to hold changes that are related to the issue you are working on. Give the <BRANCH> a name that will remind you of its purpose, including any relevant ticket numbers, such as SOFTWARE-2345.pathchange : [user@client ~ ] $ git checkout -b <BRANCH> Make your commits to this branch, then push the branch to your repo on GitHub. [user@client ~ ] $ git push origin <BRANCH> Select your branch in the GitHub web interface, then create a \"pull request\" against the original repo. Add a good description of your change into the message for the pull request. Enter a Jira ticket number in the message to automatically link the pull request to the Jira ticket. Request a review from the drop down menu on the right and wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a software team member. If the team member accepts your changes, they will merge your pull request, and your changes will be incorporated upstream. You may then delete the branch you created your pull request from. If your changes are rejected, then you may make additional changes to the branch that your pull request is for. Once you push the changes from your local repo to your GitHub repo, they will automatically be added to the pull request. Release workflow \u00b6 This section is intended for OSG Software team members or the primary developers of a software project (i.e. those that make releases). Some of the steps require direct write access the GitHub repo for the project owned by opensciencegrid . (If you can approve pull requests, you have write access). A release of a software is created from your local clone of a software project. Before you release, you need to make sure your local clone is in sync with the GitHub repo owned by opensciencegrid (the OSG repo): If you haven't already, add the OSG repo as a \"remote\" to your repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:opensciencegrid/<PROJECT> Where <PROJECT> is the name of the project you are going to release, e.g. for openscience/technology repository it would be technology.git Fetch changes from the OSG repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git fetch upstream Compare your branch you are releasing from (probably master ) to its copy in the OSG repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git checkout master ; git diff upstream/master There should be no differences. Once this is done, release the software as you usually do. This process varies from one project to another, but often it involves running make upstream or similar. Check your project's README file for instructions. Test your software. Tag the commit that you made the release from. Git release tags are conventionally called VERSION , where VERSION is the version of the software you are releasing. So if you're releasing version 1.3.0, you would create the <TAG> v1.3.0 . Note Once a tag has been pushed to the OSG repo, it should not be changed. Be sure the commit you want to tag is the final one you made the release from. Create the tag in your local repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git tag <TAG> Push the tag to your own GitHub repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git push origin <TAG> Push the tag to the OSG repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git push upstream <TAG> Best practices \u00b6 Making good pull requests (The Art of Good Commits) \u00b6 In addition to writing good code, it's important to organize your changes to make the task of reviewing them easier, both for the reviewer of the pull request, and even for yourself later. Here are some general guidelines and tips. Put logically separate changes into separate commits \u00b6 This becomes more relevant if there are a lot of changes in the pull request. Having a single commit with many different changes happening at the same time can make the changes harder to review. If possible, split up logically separate changes into separate commits. As a simple example, if you are renaming a variable in many places, and also refactoring the structure of some code, these changes can be split into two separate commits. This will make it easier when reviewing to see clearly what each commit is trying to accomplish. The process you went through to arrive at your final code may have been different, but you can clean up your commits after the fact. One method is to use git rebase -i to combine (squash) several commits into one, and then use git gui to amend the combined commit, staging the parts that represent each logical change into separate commits. Another example that occasionally comes up is when you want to copy or move a file AND make changes to that file. If you have a single commit that introduces a file to a new location with changes , it will not be obvious from the commit diff itself which parts are the same (moved or copied in) and which parts you are modifying. Instead, by putting the copy or move of the original file into its own commit, and then putting your changes in a separate commit, it will make it clear to the reviewer which parts are changing from the original. Avoid whitespace noise \u00b6 There are a few considerations to note when it comes to whitespace. Avoid adding spaces at the end of lines. These are generally considered \"noise\" that will get cleaned up later (sometimes automatically, depending on editor settings). It's not necessary to \"fix\" this kind of whitespace noise everywhere you happen to find it in existing files, but it's fine to remove trailing whitespace for lines that you are already modifying for your own changes. Do not strip the final newline at the end-of-file. Some text editors will automatically strip the final newline at the end of file, but this is a form of whitespace noise similar to trailing spaces. If that is the case for your editor, please configure it not to strip the newline at EOF. (GitHub will show the diff for files with a missing newline at EOF with a red circle-minus symbol with the mouseover text \"No newline at end of file\".) Avoid mixing tabs and spaces. With the exception of Makefiles and Go source code, indentation should be done with regular spaces, not tabs. Please configure your text editor accordingly. Mixing tabs and spaces in indentation is problematic because different editor settings can make tab stops appear at different widths. As with trailing whitespace, it's fine to convert stray tabs to spaces on lines you are modifying, but it is not necessary to fix them everywhere, if that is not the purpose of your pull request. Put large whitespace changes into a separate commit. If you do want to change a significant amount of whitespace (either converting tabs to spaces on many lines, or perhaps adjusting the amount of indentation, or wrapping text at a different width), make your whitespace-only changes as a separate commit. This will make it clear that, although many lines may be changing, there is no functional change for that particular commit. Then any functional changes to the text in a following commit will be easier to review. Don't commit large files \u00b6 Try to keep the repository small by not committing files that are too large. Avoid committing large binaries or data sets. Ask yourself if they need to be in the repository before committing. If, somehow, a large file has been committed and pushed, it's not enough to remove the file in another commit. The file must be removed from all of the history or else the repository will still contain the large file as Git keeps track of deleted files. This can be done using the git rebase -i and git filter-repo commands. If a large file must be added to the repository. Use Git LFS Verify that only the files intended are modified in each commit \u00b6 Sometimes you may have several files modified at once, but you only intend to commit a subset of the changes. In such cases you should be aware that git commit -a will include all the modified files in your commit. Likewise, if you have some untracked files in your working copy, that you do not intend to commit, be aware that git add . will introduce these as new files in the commit. Note If you do use the -a option for git commit , you may want to consider using the -v option along with it (i.e. git commit -av ), which will show you the diff to be committed in your editor while you are typing your commit message. After making a commit locally, you can verify that only the files you intended to modify were included in the commit by running git show --stat . Or to review the actual changes to those files, git show (without --stat ). If you find unintended files included in the commit, you can amend the commit so that it does not include changes to file-not-to-commit like so: [user@client ~ ] $ git reset HEAD^ file-not-to-commit [user@client ~ ] $ git commit --amend If you have multiple commits ready for a pull request, you can review the high-level changes for each commit with git log --stat origin/master.. (or origin/main.. , whichever is the name of the main origin branch). Tools like git gui also provide a way to review commits. If you find unintended files included in earlier commits, you can do a git rebase -i origin/master and edit the commits in question, which will give you a chance to amend a particular commit as shown above. Squash noisy work-in-progress commits \u00b6 Naturally in the trial-and-error-prone process of development, there will be many changes along the way that didn't make the final cut. This is good and healthy, and it's perfectly reasonable to be making many small work-in-progress commits locally while you are developing. However, for the reviewer, the relevant thing is what final changes are being introduced into the codebase. Having to review several ideas that were put into and then taken out of the changeset is a distraction, and makes it harder to see what the end result is for the new changes. If you have such work-in-progress commits, first combine them (this is also called \"squashing\" or \"rebasing\"), and then break them up into logically distinct commits as necessary, representing the final changeset. As mentioned above, one way to do this is with a combination of git rebase -i and git gui , though there are other third-party tools (e.g., magit) available also. Write a succinct subject to explain what each commit does \u00b6 The first line of a commit message is the \"subject\" (or sometimes also called the \"title\"). It should be short and sweet (at most 72 characters) and briefly state what the commit is designed to do. As a convention, the subject of the commit message should be written in the imperative - that is, it should be written as if it were a command. For instance, a subject should start with \"fix a bug\" rather than \"fixing\" or \"fixes\". Explain why a change was made in the commit message \u00b6 It is generally important also to explain why a change was made. If this is not covered by the succinct subject line of your commit, you should explain the rationale behind your change in the commit message body. (The commit message starts with the subject line, then is optionally followed by a blank line plus the message body.) You can also explain in the commit message body how this commit accomplishes the stated purpose in the subject - and you may find yourself needing to do this if there are some tricky details in the changes. But even if it is perfectly clear from the code and your commit message what you are changing and how you are going about it, it is not always clear why the change is needed or desired - so it is important to explain your reasons, in order to make this clear to the reviewer. For an example of \"explaining your reasons\", see this commit message body . Summarize your commits in the pull request title \u00b6 The title of a pull request is analogous to the subject of a commit. If you have only one commit in your pull request, GitHub will by default set the pull request title and body to match that commit's subject and body; and that default is acceptable for single-commit pull requests. But if you have multiple commits in your pull request, you should try to capture the overall goal of these commits in your pull request title. In the pull request body, you can also mention or discuss the high-level changes from each commit, and if relevant discuss how these changes work together for the overall goal of the pull request. Choose a separate, descriptive branch name for each pull request \u00b6 GitHub allows creating pull requests entirely on their web interface, and will automatically suggest a generic branch name like patch-42 . But this is boring and not especially helpful to the reviewer or to the one submitting the pull request. Instead, choose a short name for the branch that describes the topic of the changes or the feature being introduced. For instance, fix-memory-leak or scitokens-support . (As will be discussed more later, it is best to prefix the branch name with a ticket reference as well.) Note that each pull request should get its own branch name, even if two pull requests are for the same ticket and the topic is similar. New commits pushed to a branch for a pull request will automatically show up as part of that pull request; so a second pull request needs a separate branch to track the separate set of changes. Reference any relevant tickets \u00b6 Code changes often are related to a Jira ticket, for instance SOFTWARE-1234. By referencing the name of a ticket in your pull request, it provides a convenient way to look into the background context for the change; and later on down the road, it makes it easy to find which changes were made for a particular task, referenced by the ticket name. Ideally, you can include a ticket reference each of these three places: Your branch name. For example, name the branch in your fork of the GitHub repo for the pull request SOFTWARE-1234.fix-memory-leak . Your commit messages. For example, the subject of your commit message might read, fix a memory leak (SOFTWARE-1234) . If you have trouble squeezing the ticket name into the subject line, or if you have a number of related tickets that you want to reference, it is also OK to mention them later in the commit message body. The pull request title. If your pull request is just a single commit, and you have the ticket reference in the subject line of the commit message, GitHub will include this in the pull request title automatically. But if you have multiple commits, or you have only included the ticket reference in the body of the commit message, or more generally if you want to tweak the title of the pull request, you should in any case make a point to include the ticket name in the title of the pull request. (By convention, we include this at the end of the title, in parentheses.) If there is no ticket associated with your changes, consider creating one (or asking an OSG software team member to create one) before submitting your pull request. Further reading \u00b6 There are a number of articles and guides for making good git commits and good pull requests - a simple search will turn up plenty of material for the interested reader. See online guides such as this one for more details. Brownie points \u00b6 You will get brownie points from Carl, personally, if you strive to make your code (and other text files) fit within an 80-column terminal window. Reviewing pull requests \u00b6 There are a couple items to note about the review process for GitHub pull requests. Batch comments in a formal review \u00b6 When reviewing a pull request, GitHub allows you to comment on lines and presents the option to \"Add single comment\" or \"Start a review\". A single comment added will not be tied to your review, and a separate email notification will be sent for every time you click \"Add single comment\". Especially for reviewing larger pull requests, we generally prefer to \"Start a review\", and then \"Add review comment\" for subsequent comments. This will tie all of your comments and suggestions together as part of your review. When you complete your review, you will have the opportunity to make summary comments about the changes, when you select Approve/Comment/Request changes. By \"batching\" all of your review comments this way, a single email notification will be sent for your review, which contains all of your review comments together. Batch commits when accepting suggestions from a review \u00b6 When someone reviews your pull request, they may make suggestions that tweak your changes. Similar to review comments, suggestions from a review can either be applied one at a time (Commit suggestion), or they can be batched and applied together. To batch suggestions, first you need to open the \"Files changed\" tab; then for each suggestion you want to accept, click \"Add suggestion to batch\". Finally, click \"Commit suggestions\" to apply all batched suggestions as a single commit. Generally we prefer to batch related changes or miscellaneous tweaks rather than applying each one individually. But if there are a number of suggestions of a different nature, it is OK to group them such that you apply one batch for each set of related suggestions (consistent with the guideline to put logically separate changes into separate commits).","title":"Git Software Development Process"},{"location":"software/git-software-development/#git-software-development-workflow","text":"This document describes the development workflow for OSG software packages kept in GitHub.

[user@client ~ ] $ git clone git@github.com:<USERNAME/PROJECT> Where <USERNAME> is your github username and <PROJECT> is the name of the project you want to contribute to, e.g. in order to clone my local fork of the openscience/technology repository: [user@client ~ ] $ git clone https://github.com/ddavila0/technology.git Note If you get a \"Permission denied\" error, your public key may not be set up with GitHub -- please see the \"Getting shell access to GitHub\" section above. If you get some other error, the GitHub page on SSH may contain useful information on troubleshooting. Once you have your local repo, do the following: Create a branch to hold changes that are related to the issue you are working on. Give the <BRANCH> a name that will remind you of its purpose, including any relevant ticket numbers, such as SOFTWARE-2345.pathchange : [user@client ~ ] $ git checkout -b <BRANCH> Make your commits to this branch, then push the branch to your repo on GitHub. [user@client ~ ] $ git push origin <BRANCH> Select your branch in the GitHub web interface, then create a \"pull request\" against the original repo. Add a good description of your change into the message for the pull request. Enter a Jira ticket number in the message to automatically link the pull request to the Jira ticket. Request a review from the drop down menu on the right and wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a software team member. If the team member accepts your changes, they will merge your pull request, and your changes will be incorporated upstream. You may then delete the branch you created your pull request from.

Some of the steps require direct write access the GitHub repo for the project owned by opensciencegrid . (If you can approve pull requests, you have write access). A release of a software is created from your local clone of a software project. Before you release, you need to make sure your local clone is in sync with the GitHub repo owned by opensciencegrid (the OSG repo): If you haven't already, add the OSG repo as a \"remote\" to your repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:opensciencegrid/<PROJECT> Where <PROJECT> is the name of the project you are going to release, e.g. for openscience/technology repository it would be technology.git Fetch changes from the OSG repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git fetch upstream Compare your branch you are releasing from (probably master ) to its copy in the OSG repo: [user@client ~ ] $ git checkout master ; git diff upstream/master There should be no differences. Once this is done, release the software as you usually do. This process varies from one project to another, but often it involves running make upstream or similar. Check your project's README file for instructions. Test your software. Tag the commit that you made the release from. Git release tags are conventionally called VERSION , where VERSION is the version of the software you are releasing. So if you're releasing version 1.3.0, you would create the <TAG> v1.3.0 . Note Once a tag has been pushed to the OSG repo, it should not be changed. Be sure the commit you want to tag is the final one you made the release from.

Having a single commit with many different changes happening at the same time can make the changes harder to review. If possible, split up logically separate changes into separate commits. As a simple example, if you are renaming a variable in many places, and also refactoring the structure of some code, these changes can be split into two separate commits. This will make it easier when reviewing to see clearly what each commit is trying to accomplish. The process you went through to arrive at your final code may have been different, but you can clean up your commits after the fact. One method is to use git rebase -i to combine (squash) several commits into one, and then use git gui to amend the combined commit, staging the parts that represent each logical change into separate commits. Another example that occasionally comes up is when you want to copy or move a file AND make changes to that file. If you have a single commit that introduces a file to a new location with changes , it will not be obvious from the commit diff itself which parts are the same (moved or copied in) and which parts you are modifying. Instead, by putting the copy or move of the original file into its own commit, and then putting your changes in a separate commit, it will make it clear to the reviewer which parts are changing from the original.","title":"Put logically separate changes into separate commits"},{"location":"software/git-software-development/#avoid-whitespace-noise","text":"There are a few considerations to note when it comes to whitespace. Avoid adding spaces at the end of lines. These are generally considered \"noise\" that will get cleaned up later (sometimes automatically, depending on editor settings). It's not necessary to \"fix\" this kind of whitespace noise everywhere you happen to find it in existing files, but it's fine to remove trailing whitespace for lines that you are already modifying for your own changes. Do not strip the final newline at the end-of-file. Some text editors will automatically strip the final newline at the end of file, but this is a form of whitespace noise similar to trailing spaces. If that is the case for your editor, please configure it not to strip the newline at EOF. (GitHub will show the diff for files with a missing newline at EOF with a red circle-minus symbol with the mouseover text \"No newline at end of file\".) Avoid mixing tabs and spaces. With the exception of Makefiles and Go source code, indentation should be done with regular spaces, not tabs. Please configure your text editor accordingly. Mixing tabs and spaces in indentation is problematic because different editor settings can make tab stops appear at different widths. As with trailing whitespace, it's fine to convert stray tabs to spaces on lines you are modifying, but it is not necessary to fix them everywhere, if that is not the purpose of your pull request. Put large whitespace changes into a separate commit. If you do want to change a significant amount of whitespace (either converting tabs to spaces on many lines, or perhaps adjusting the amount of indentation, or wrapping text at a different width), make your whitespace-only changes as a separate commit. This will make it clear that, although many lines may be changing, there is no functional change for that particular commit.

Note If you do use the -a option for git commit , you may want to consider using the -v option along with it (i.e. git commit -av ), which will show you the diff to be committed in your editor while you are typing your commit message. After making a commit locally, you can verify that only the files you intended to modify were included in the commit by running git show --stat . Or to review the actual changes to those files, git show (without --stat ). If you find unintended files included in the commit, you can amend the commit so that it does not include changes to file-not-to-commit like so: [user@client ~ ] $ git reset HEAD^ file-not-to-commit [user@client ~ ] $ git commit --amend If you have multiple commits ready for a pull request, you can review the high-level changes for each commit with git log --stat origin/master..

If you have such work-in-progress commits, first combine them (this is also called \"squashing\" or \"rebasing\"), and then break them up into logically distinct commits as necessary, representing the final changeset.

Due to tricky build dependencies and unexpected build failures, this can be a messy task; and in the past we have gone about it in an ad-hoc manner. This document will discuss some of the aspects of the task and issues involved, some possible approaches, and ultimately a proposal for a general tool or procedure for doing our mass rebuilds. New RHEL version vs new OSG series \u00b6 New RHEL version \u00b6 For a new RHEL version, we start with no osg packages to build against, so we are forced to build things in dependency order. Figuring out the dependency order is possibly the most difficult (or interesting) part of doing mass rebuilds -- more on that later. New OSG series \u00b6 For a new OSG series within an existing RHEL version, we have more options. While it's possible to \"start from scratch\" the same way we would with a new RHEL version and build everything in dependency order, this is not really necessary if we take advantage of existing builds from the previous series. A prior step is to determine the package list for the new series -- this will be some combination of Upcoming and the current release series, minus any packages pruned for the new series. This should also be reflected in the new trunk packaging area. All the current builds for packages in that list (from upcoming + current series) can be tagged into the new *-development (or *-build) repos. This should make all of the build dependencies available for mass rebuilding the new series all at once (osg-build koji *). After some consideration, I wholeheartedly endorse this approach for new OSG series -- for all but academic exercises. Rebuilding in dependency order when all the dependencies are already built just seems like wasted effort. Doing scratch builds of everything first \u00b6 Before doing the mass rebuilds in a new build target, it seems to be a good idea to do scratch builds of all the packages in the current series first. (Or, at least the ones we intend to bring into the new build target.) This will give us a chance to see any build failures that have crept in (possibly due to upstream changes in the OS or EPEL), and fix them first if desired, but in any case avoid the confusion of seeing the failures for the first time in the new build target. Doing mass scratch rebuilds for an existing series is easy, as they can all be done at once. Relatedly, doing a round of scratch builds after successfully building all packages into a new build target can also be useful, because it can reveal dependency issues only present in the new set of builds. Doing developer test installs or a round of VMU tests may also uncover any runtime dependency issues. Options for calculating build dependencies \u00b6 We can get dependency information from a number of places: scraping .spec files for Requires/BuildRequires/Provides and %package names querying existing rpms directly on koji-hub and our OS/EPEL mirrors ( rpm -q ) querying srpms from osg-build prebuild directly for build requirements inspecting previous buildroots to determine resolved build dependencies use repoquery to determine whatrequires/whatprovides for packages use yum-builddep to find packages with all build requirements available using the repodata (primary+filelists) from rpm repositories, including: upcoming + 3.X development + external repos (Centos/EPEL/JPackage), OR osg-upcoming-elX-build, which includes them all One important aspect is that the runtime requirements are also relevant for determining build requirements, since a build will require installing all of the runtime requirements of the packages required for the build. That is, (A BuildRequires B) and (B Requires C) implies A BuildRequires C . Combined with the fact that runtime requirements are transitive, that is, (A Requires B) and (B Requires C) implies A Requires C , computing build requirements is a recursive operation, which can be many levels deep. Another question to keep in mind is whether to use versioned requires/provides (i.e., BuildRequires xyz >= 1.2-3) or to only pay attention to the package/capability names. Similarly, whether to pay any attention to conflicts/obsoletes. These would add complexity to anything except the standard tools (repoquery, yum-builddep) which already take these things into account. (And we may get pretty far even without paying attention to versions.) Note also that the dependencies/capabilities for a given package often varies between different rhel versions. Pre-computing (predictive) vs just-in-time \u00b6 Two different approaches to determining dependency order for building are: pre compute all dependencies based on an existing series/rhel version, OR compute which remaining packages have all build reqs satisfied now The first approach has the benefit of being able to determine the packages that need to be built in order to accomplish a smaller subset goal first -- for example, to be able to install osg-wn-client. (And, if there are problems with resolving certain dependencies (say with osg-wn-client again), it will become apparent earlier, as opposed to not until all possible-to-build packages have been built.) The limitation of this approach is that the predicted set of files/capabilities that a binary package will provide may differ between osg series/rhel versions, and as a result may be inaccurate for the new build target. The second approach provides somewhat more confidence about being able to correctly determine which packages should be buildable at any point in time, but (as mentioned above) it is a bit more in the dark about seeing the bigger picture of the dependency graph or being able to build subsets of targets. It may be useful to have both options available -- building from the list in the second approach, but using the first mechanism to have a better picture of where things are at, or perhaps to steer toward finishing a certain subset of packages first. Package list closure, pruning \u00b6 At some point (either in the planning stage or after building packages into the new build target), we need to ensure that the new osg series/rhel version contains all of its install requirements for all of its packages. It would probably suffice to do a VMU run that installs each package (perhaps individually, to avoid conflicts). But if we go about it more analytically, we may also get, as a result, a list of packages which we previously only maintained for the purpose of building our other packages (ie, that were never required at runtime for any use cases that we cared about), which now, in the new target, are no longer build requirements (directly or indirectly) for any packages that we care about installing. Packages in this category could be reviewed to also be dropped from the new build target. Proposal / Recommendations \u00b6 As mentioned earlier, my recommendation is that we treat a new OSG series differently than a new RHEL version. For a new OSG series: \u00b6 update native/redhat packaging area to reflect packages for new series, including upcoming + trunk - removed packages tag existing builds of packages in new list into the new development tag (eg, for osg-3.3-el6, tag the .osgup.el6 and .osg32.el6 builds into osg-3.3-el6-development) build all packages in new packaging area into new build target at once for all successful builds, remove corresponding old builds (eg, .osgup/.osg32) from the new tag (osg-3.3-el6-development) For a new RHEL version: \u00b6 pull the repodata from the relevant *-build repo from koji: for pre-computing, use a build repo from an existing rhel version: https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el6-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/ for just-in-time, use the new build repo: https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el8-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/ the primary and filelists (sqlite) files can be used to get runtime requires and provides. (Note that this includes packages from the relevant external repos, also.) generate srpms repodata for the current set of packages to build, with osg-build prebuild and createrepo. the primary (sqlite) file can be used to get build-requires. use sql to resolve direct dependencies at the package name level: src-pkg: bin-pkg (BuildRequires) bin-pkg: bin-pkg (Requires) bin-pkg: src-pkg (bin-pkg comes from which src-pkg? only needed for pre-computing dependencies) resolve this list into a full list of recursive build dependencies. Since this is recursive, there is no way to do it in a fixed number of sql queries. However the above input list is already directly consumable by Make, which is designed to handle recursive dependencies just like this.

It is meant primarily for OSG Software team members who need to interact with the service. Terminology \u00b6 Using and understanding the following terminology correctly will help in the reading of this document: Package This refers to a named piece of software in the Koji database. An example would be \"lcmaps\". Build A specific version and release of a package, and an associated state. A build state may be successful (and contain RPMs), failed, or in-progress. A given build may be in one or more tags. The build is associated with the output of the latest build task with the same version and release of the package. Tag A named set of packages and builds, parent tags, and reference to external repositories. An example would be the \"osg-3.3-el6-development\" tag, which contains (among others) the \"lcmaps\" package and the \"lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6\" build. There is an inheritance structure to tags: by default, all packages/builds in a parent tag are added to the tag. A tag may contain a reference to (possibly inherited) external repositories; the RPMs in these repositories are added to repositories created from this tag. Examples of referenced external repositories include CentOS base, EPEL, or JPackage. Note A tag is NOT a yum repository. Target A target consists of a build tag and a destination tag. An example is \"osg-3.3-el6\", where the build tag is \"osg-3.3-el6-build\" and the destination tag is \"osg-3.3-el6\". A target is used by the build task to know what repository to build from and tag to build into. Task A unit of work for Koji. Several common tasks are: build This task takes a SRPM and a target, and attempts to create a complete Build in the target's destination tag from the target's build repository. This task will launch one buildArch task for each architecture in the destination tag; if each subtask is successful, then it will launch a tagBuild subtask. Note If the build task is marked as \"scratch\", then it won't result in a saved Build. buildArch This task takes a SRPM, architecture name, and a Koji repository as an input, and runs mock to create output RPMs for that arch. The build artifacts are added to the Build if all buildArch tasks are successful. tagBuild This adds a successful build to a given tag. newRepo This creates a new repository from a given tag. Build artifacts The results of a buildArch task. Their metadata are recorded in the Koji database, and files are saved to disk. Metadata may include checksums, timestamps, and who initiated the task. Artifacts may include RPMs, SRPMs, and build logs. Repository A yum repository created from the contents of a tag at a specific point in time. By default, the yum repository will contain all successful, non-blocked builds in the tag, plus all RPMs in the external repositories for the tag. Obtaining Access \u00b6 Building OSG packages in Koji requires these privileges: access to the OSG subversion repository at https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn access to a login node at UW Comp Sci such as moria.cs.wisc.edu access to the Koji service via a grid user certificate See the old user certificates document for information about how to get a user certificate. Open a Freshdesk ticket with the subject \"Requesting access to Koji\" with the following information: - top 3 username choices for the login node and SVN (8 characters max, no punctuation) - the DN of your user certificate Assign the ticket to the Software team. Initial Setup \u00b6 You will be using the OSG Build Tools to interact with Koji. You can use them on either your own machine or on your UW Comp Sci login node such as moria . Setting up on moria \u00b6 Perform the following to set up the build tools on moria : Clone the osg-build git repo you@moria$ git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build $HOME /osg-build Set your $PATH : you@moria$ export PATH = $PATH : $HOME /osg-build you@moria$ export PATH = $PATH :/p/vdt/workspace/quilt/bin you@moria$ export PATH = $PATH :/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/stable/sys Copy your user certificate and key into $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem and $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem . Make sure userkey.pem is only readable by yourself. (Optional) Load your certificate into your browser. This will allow you to make some changes using the Koji web interface . Set up the OSG Koji config you@moria$ osg-koji setup Answer \"yes\" to all questions. Setting up on your own host \u00b6 This requires an Enterprise Linux 6 or 7 host. Install the OSG YUM repositories If using OSG 3.5 or newer, enable the devops repository. Install osg-build and its dependencies: you@host$ sudo yum install osg-build Install a program for getting grid certificates you@host$ sudo yum install globus-proxy-utils Note If you already have voms-clients-cpp or voms-clients-java installed, you can use voms-proxy-init -rfc instead of grid-proxy-init , and don't need to install globus-proxy-utils . (Optional) If you want to do mock builds (these are local builds in a chroot), add yourself to the mock user group: you@host$ sudo usermod -a -G mock $USER Copy your user certificate and key into $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem and $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem . Make sure userkey.pem is only readable by yourself. Note If you are using a certificate from SAML or Kerberos credentials, such as with cigetcert or kx509 , skip this step. (Optional) Load your certificate into your browser. This will allow you to make some changes using the Koji web interface . Set up the OSG Koji config you@moria$ osg-koji setup Answer \"yes\" to all questions. Authenticating to Koji \u00b6 To use the OSG Build tools and the Koji command-line client, you will need to make sure you can authenticate to Koji. This involves getting a grid proxy certificate. Do one of the following: On moria Run osgrun grid-proxy-init -bits 2048 and type your grid certificate password. If you cannot find osgrun , ensure you have /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/stable/sys in your $PATH . On your local machine Run grid-proxy-init -bits 2048 (if using globus-proxy-utils ) or voms-proxy-init -rfc -bits 2048 (if using voms-clients ) and type your grid certificate password. On your local machine using SAML or Kerberos-based credentials Run cigetcert or kx509 and perform whatever identification challenges you are asked. To verify your login access and permissions, run: you@host$ osg-koji list-permissions --mine You should see a list of your permissions if successful, or an error message if unsuccessful. Note If you see the error SSL: EE_KEY_TOO_SMALL , OpenSSL may be rejecting your proxy because it is too short. Be sure to request at least 2048 bits by passing -bits 2048 to grid-proxy-init or voms-proxy-init . You can check the key length by examining your proxy: you@host$ openssl x509 -in /tmp/x509up_u $( id -u ) -noout -text and looking at the \"Subject Public Key Info\" which might look like Subject Public Key Info: Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption RSA Public-Key: (2048 bit) Using Koji \u00b6 Creating a new build \u00b6 We create a new build in Koji from the package's directory in OSG Software subversion. If a successful build already exists in Koji (regardless of whether it is in the tag you use), you cannot replace the build. Two builds are the same if they have the same NVR (Name-Version-Release). You can do a \"scratch\" build, which recompiles, but the results are not added to the tag. This is useful for experimenting with koji. To do a build, execute the following command from within the OSG Software subversion checkout: [you@host]$ osg-build koji <PACKAGE NAME> To do a scratch build, simply add the --scratch command line flag. When you do a non-scratch build, it will build with the osg-el6 and osg-el7 targets. This will assign your build the osg-3.4-el6-development and osg-3.4-el7-development tags (and your package will be assigned the osg-el6 and osg-el7 tags). If successful, your build will end up in the Koji osg-minefield yum repos and will eventually show up in the osg-development yum repos. This is a high latency process. Build task Results \u00b6 How to find build results \u00b6 The most recent build results are always shown on the home page of Koji: https://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/index Clicking on a build result brings you to the build information page. A successful build will result in the build page having build logs, RPMs, and a SRPM. If your build isn't in the recent list, you can use the search box in the upper-right-hand corner. Type the exact package name (or use a wildcard), and it will bring up a list of all builds for that package. You can find your build from there. For example, the \"lcmaps\" package page is here: https://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=56 And the lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6 build is here: https://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=7427 Trying our your build \u00b6 Because it takes a while for your build to get into one of the regular repositories, it's simplest to download your RPM directly (see the previous section on How to find build results), and install it with: [root@host]# yum localinstall <RPM> How to get the resulting RPM into a repository \u00b6 Once a package has been built, it is added to a tag. We then must turn the tag into a yum repository. This is normally done automatically and you do not need to deal with it yourself. Three notes: The kojira daemon creates a repository automatically post-build on the koji-hub host. Eventually, the development repository will be the one hosted by koji-hub. The koji-hub repository can be created manually by running [you@host]$ osg-koji regen-repo <TAG NAME> For example, the tag name for osg-development in 3.4 on el6 is \"osg-3.4-el6-development\". Likely, you won't need to do this when kojira is working. - Repositories are created on external hosts with the mash tool. These are usually triggered by cron jobs, but may be run by hand too. Documentation for running mash is on the TODO list. - You can create your own personal repository using mash . Debugging build issues \u00b6 Failed build tasks can be seen from the Koji homepage. The logs from the tasks are included. Relevant logs include: root.log This is the log of mock trying to create an appropriate build root for your RPM. This will invoke yum twice: once to create a generic build root, once for all the dependencies in your BuildRequires. All RPMs in your build root will be logged here. If mock is unable to create the build root, the reason will show up here. 404 Errors If you see Error downloading packages and HTTP Error 404 - Not Found errors in your root.log , this commonly indicates that an rpm repo mirror was updated and our build repo is out-of-date. This can be fixed by regenerating the relevant build repos for your builds. This is usually something like osg-3.4-el7-build or osg-upcoming-el7-build ; but you can find the exact build tag by clicking the Build Target link for the koji task, and whatever is listed for the Build Tag is the name of the repo to regen. Regenerate each repo that failed with 404 errors: $ osg-koji regen-repo <BUILD TAG> build.log The output of the rpmbuild executable. If your package fails to compile, the reason will show up here. One input to the buildArch task is a repository, which is based on a Koji tag. If the repository hasn't been recreated for a dependency you need (for example, when kojira isn't working), you may not have the right RPMs available in your build root. One common issue is building a chain of dependencies. For example, suppose build B depends on the results of build A. If you build A then build B immediately, B will likely fail. This is because A is not in the repository that B uses. The proper string of events building A, starting the regeneration of the destination and build repo (which should happen in a few minutes of the build A task completing), then submitting build task B. Note if you submit build task B while the build repository task is open, it will not start until the build task has finished. Other errors package <PACKAGE NAME> not in list for tag <TAG> This happens when the name of the directory your package is in does not match the name of the package. You must rename one or the other and commit your changes before trying again. Promoting Builds from Development -> Testing \u00b6 Software contributors can promote any package to testing. Members of the security team can promote ca-cert packages to testing. To promote from development to testing: Using osg-promote \u00b6 Before using osg-promote , authenticate to Koji as above . If you want to promote the latest version: [you@host]$ osg-promote -r <OSGVER>-testing <PACKAGE NAME> <PACKAGE NAME> is the bare package name without version, e.g. gratia-probe . If you want to promote a specific version: [you@host]$ osg-promote -r <OSGVER>-testing <BUILD NAME> <BUILD NAME> is a full name-version-revision.disttag such as gratia-probe-1.17.0-2.osg33.el6 . <OSGVER> is the OSG major version that you are promoting for (e.g. 3.4 ). osg-promote will promote both the el6 and el7 builds of a package. After promoting, copy and paste the JIRA code osg-promote produces into the JIRA ticket that you are working on. For osg-promote , you may omit the .osg34.el6 or .osg34.el7 ; the script will add the appropriate disttag on. See OSG Building Tools for full details on osg-promote . Creating custom koji areas \u00b6 Occasionally you may want to make builds of a package (or packages) which you do not yet want to go into the main development repos. In this case, you can create a set of custom koji tags and build targets for these builds. We have a script in our osg-next-tools repo called new-koji-area that facilitates this set up.

It is meant primarily for OSG Software team members who need to interact with the service.","title":"Koji Workflow"},{"location":"software/koji-workflow/#terminology","text":"Using and understanding the following terminology correctly will help in the reading of this document: Package This refers to a named piece of software in the Koji database. An example would be \"lcmaps\". Build A specific version and release of a package, and an associated state. A build state may be successful (and contain RPMs), failed, or in-progress. A given build may be in one or more tags. The build is associated with the output of the latest build task with the same version and release of the package. Tag A named set of packages and builds, parent tags, and reference to external repositories. An example would be the \"osg-3.3-el6-development\" tag, which contains (among others) the \"lcmaps\" package and the \"lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6\" build. There is an inheritance structure to tags: by default, all packages/builds in a parent tag are added to the tag. A tag may contain a reference to (possibly inherited) external repositories; the RPMs in these repositories are added to repositories created from this tag. Examples of referenced external repositories include CentOS base, EPEL, or JPackage. Note A tag is NOT a yum repository. Target A target consists of a build tag and a destination tag. An example is \"osg-3.3-el6\", where the build tag is \"osg-3.3-el6-build\" and the destination tag is \"osg-3.3-el6\". A target is used by the build task to know what repository to build from and tag to build into. Task A unit of work for Koji. Several common tasks are: build This task takes a SRPM and a target, and attempts to create a complete Build in the target's destination tag from the target's build repository. This task will launch one buildArch task for each architecture in the destination tag; if each subtask is successful, then it will launch a tagBuild subtask. Note If the build task is marked as \"scratch\", then it won't result in a saved Build. buildArch This task takes a SRPM, architecture name, and a Koji repository as an input, and runs mock to create output RPMs for that arch. The build artifacts are added to the Build if all buildArch tasks are successful. tagBuild This adds a successful build to a given tag. newRepo This creates a new repository from a given tag. Build artifacts The results of a buildArch task. Their metadata are recorded in the Koji database, and files are saved to disk. Metadata may include checksums, timestamps, and who initiated the task. Artifacts may include RPMs, SRPMs, and build logs. Repository A yum repository created from the contents of a tag at a specific point in time. By default, the yum repository will contain all successful, non-blocked builds in the tag, plus all RPMs in the external repositories for the tag.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"software/koji-workflow/#obtaining-access","text":"Building OSG packages in Koji requires these privileges: access to the OSG subversion repository at https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn access to a login node at UW Comp Sci such as moria.cs.wisc.edu access to the Koji service via a grid user certificate See the old user certificates document for information about how to get a user certificate.

See the RPM development guide for the principles on which these tools are based. The tools are distributed in the osg-build RPM in our repositories, but can also be used from a Git clone of opensciencegrid/osg-build on GitHub . This page is up-to-date as of osg-build version 1.14.1. The tools \u00b6 osg-build \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 This is the primary tool used in building source and binary RPMs. osg-build <TASK> [options] <PACKAGE DIRECTORY> [...] package_directory is a directory containing an osg/ and/or an upstream/ subdirectory. See the RPM development guide for how these directories are organized. Tasks \u00b6 koji \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package, then builds it remotely using the Koji instance hosted at UW-Madison. https://koji.opensciencegrid.org By default, the resulting RPMs will end up in the osg-minefield repositories based on the most recent OSG major version (e.g. 3.4). You may specify a different set of repos with --repo , described later. RPMs from the osg-minefield repositories are regularly pulled to the osg-development repositories hosted by the GOC at http://repo.opensciencegrid.org Unless you specify otherwise (by passing --el6 , --el7 or specifying a different koji tag/target), the package will be built for both el6 and el7. This is the method used to build final versions of packages you expect to ship. lint \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package, then runs rpmlint on it to check for various problems. You will need to have rpmlint installed. People on UW CSL machines should add /p/vdt/workspace/rpmlint to their $PATH. mock \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package, then builds it locally using mock , and stores the resulting source and binary RPMs in the package-specific _build_results directory. prebuild \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package from upstream sources (if any) and local files (if any). May create or overwrite the _upstream_srpm_contents and _final_srpm_contents directories. prepare \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package, then calls rpmbuild -bp on the result, extracting and patching the source files (and performing any other steps defined in the %prep section of the spec file. The resulting sources will be under _final_srpm_contents . rpmbuild \u00b6 Prebuilds the final source package, then builds it locally using rpmbuild , and stores the resulting source and binary RPMs in the package-specific _build_results directory. quilt \u00b6 Collects the upstream local sources and spec file, then calls quilt setup on the spec file, extracting the source files and adding the patches to a quilt series file. See Quilt documentation (PDF link) for more information on quilt; also look at the example in the Usage Patterns section below. Similar to prepare (in fact, quilt calls rpmbuild -bp behind the scenes), but the source tree is in pre-patch state, and various quilt commands can be used to apply and modify patches. Unpacks into _quilt as of osg-build-1.2.2 or _final_srpm_contents in previous versions. Requires quilt . People on UW CSL machines should add /p/vdt/workspace/quilt/bin to their $PATH , and /p/vdt/workspace/quilt/share/man to their $MANPATH . Options \u00b6 This section lists the command-line options. --help \u00b6 Prints the built-in usage information and exits without doing anything else. --version \u00b6 Prints the version of osg-build and exits without doing anything else. Common Options \u00b6 -a, --autoclean, --no-autoclean \u00b6 Before each build, clean out the contents of the underscore directories (_build_results, _final_srpm_contents, _upstream_srpm_contents, _upstream_tarball_contents). If the directories are not cleaned up, earlier builds of a package may interfere with later ones. --no-autoclean will disable this. Default is true . Has no effect with the --vcs flag. -c, --cache-prefix prefix \u00b6 Sets the prefix for upstream source cache references. The prefix must be a valid URI starting with either http , https , or file , or one of the following special values: AFS (corresponds to file:///p/vdt/public/html/upstream , which is the location of the VDT cache using AFS from a UW CS machine). VDT (corresponds to http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream , which is the location of the VDT cache from off-site). AUTO (AFS if available, VDT if not) The upstream source cache must be organized as described above. All files referenced by .source files in the affected packages must exist in the cache, or a runtime error will occur. Default is AUTO . Has no effect with the --vcs flag. --el6, --el7, --redhat-release version (Config: redhat_release) \u00b6 Sets the distro version to build for. This affects the %dist tag, the mock config, and the default koji tag and target (unless otherwise specified). --el6 is equivalent to --redhat-release 6 --el7 is equivalent to --redhat-release 7 --loglevel loglevel \u00b6 Sets the verbosity of the script. Valid values are: debug , info , warning , error and critical . Default is info . -q, --quiet \u00b6 Do not display as much information. Equivalent to --loglevel warning -v, --verbose \u00b6 Display more information. Equivalent to --loglevel debug -w, --working-directory path \u00b6 Use path as the root directory of the files created by the script. For example, if path is $HOME/working , and the package being built is ndt , the following tree will be created: $HOME/working/ndt/_upstream_srpm_contents $HOME/working/ndt/_upstream_tarball_contents $HOME/working/ndt/_final_srpm_contents $HOME/working/ndt/_build_results If path is TEMP , a randomly named directory under /tmp is used as the working directory. The default setting is to use the package directory as the working directory. Has no effect with the --vcs flag. Options specific to prebuild task \u00b6 --full-extract \u00b6 If set, all upstream tarballs will be extracted into _upstream_tarball_contents/ during the prebuild step. This flag is now mostly redundant with the prepare and quilt tasks. Options specific to rpmbuild and mock tasks \u00b6 --distro-tag dist \u00b6 Sets the distribution tag added on to the end of the release in the RPM ( rpmbuild and mock tasks only ). Default is .osg.el6 or .osg.el7 -t, --target-arch arch \u00b6 Specify an architecture to build packages for ( rpmbuild and mock tasks only ). Default is unspecified, which builds for the current machine architecture. Options specific to mock task \u00b6 --mock-clean, --no-mock-clean \u00b6 Enable/disable deletion of the mock buildroot after a successful build. Default is true . -m, --mock-config path \u00b6 Specifies the mock configuration file to use. This file details how to set up the build environment used by mock for the build, including Yum repositories from which to install dependencies and certain predefined variables (e.g., the distribution tag %dist ). See also --mock-config-from-koji . --mock-config-from-koji build tag \u00b6 Creates a mock config from a Koji build tag. This is the most accurate way to replicate the build environment that Koji will provide (outside of Koji). The build tag is based on the distro version (el6, el7) and the OSG major version (3.3, 3.4). For 3.4 on el6, it is: osg-3.4-el6-build Also requires the Koji command-line tools (package koji ), obtainable from the osg repositories. Since this uses koji, some of the koji-specific options may apply, namely: --koji-backend , --koji-login , and --koji-wrapper . Options specific to koji task \u00b6 --dry-run \u00b6 Do not actually run koji, merely show the command(s) that will be run. For debugging purposes. --getfiles, --get-files \u00b6 For scratch builds without --vcs only. Download the resulting RPMs and logs from the build into the _build_results directory. -k, --kojilogin, --koji-login login \u00b6 Sets the login to use for the koji task. This should most likely be your CN. If not specified, will extract it from your client cert ( ~/.osg-koji/client.crt or ~/.koji/client.crt ). --koji-target target \u00b6 The koji target to use for building. Default is osg-el6 for el6 and osg-el7 for el7. --koji-tag tag \u00b6 The koji tag to add packages to. See the Koji Workflow guide for more information on the terminology. The special value TARGET uses the destination tag defined in the koji target. Default is osg-el6 or osg-el7 . --ktt, --koji-tag-and-target arg \u00b6 Shorthand for setting both --koji-tag and --koji-target to arg . --koji-wrapper, --no-koji-wrapper \u00b6 Enable/disable use of the osg-koji wrapper script around koji. See below for a description of osg-koji . Default is true . --koji-backend backend \u00b6 Specifies the method osg-build will use to interface with Koji. This can be shell or kojilib . --wait, --no-wait, --nowait \u00b6 Wait for koji tasks to finish. Bad for running multiple builds in a single command, since you will have to type in your passphrase for the first one, wait for it to complete, then type in your passphrase for the second one, wait for it to complete, etc. If you want to wait for multiple tasks to finish, use the koji watch-task command or look at the website https://koji.opensciencegrid.org . --wait used to be the default until osg-build-1.1.3 --regen-repos \u00b6 Start a regen-repo koji task on the build tag after each koji build, to update the build repository used for the next build. Not useful unless you are launching multiple builds. This enables you to launch builds that depend on each other. Doesn't work too well with --no-wait , since the next build may be started before the regen-repo task is complete. Waiting will keep the next build from being queued until the regen-repo is complete. --scratch, --no-scratch \u00b6 Perform scratch builds. A scratch build does not go into a repository, but the name-version-release (NVR) of the created RPMs are not considered used, so the build may be modified and repeated without needing a release bump. This has the same use case as the mock task: creating packages that you want to test before releasing. If you do not have a machine with mock set up, or want to test exactly the environment that Koji provides, scratch builds might be more convenient. --vcs, --no-vcs, --svn, --no-svn \u00b6 Have Koji check the package out from a version control system instead of creating an SRPM on the local machine and submitting that to Koji. Currently, SVN and Git are supported. If this flag is specified, you may use SVN URLs or URL@Revision pairs to specify the packages to build. You may continue specify package directories from an SVN checkout, in which case osg-build will use svn info to find the right URL@Revision pair to use and warn you about uncommitted changes. osg-build will also warn you about an outdated working directory. --vcs defaults to true for non-scratch builds, and false for scratch builds. --repo= destination repository , --upcoming \u00b6 Selects the repositories (osg-3.3, upcoming, etc.) to build packages for. Currently valid repositories are: Repository Description osg OSG Software development repos for trunk (this is the default) osg-3.3 (or just 3.3) OSG Software development repos for 3.3 branch upcoming OSG Software development repos for upcoming branch internal OSG Software internal branch hcc Holland Computing Center (Nebraska) testing repos --upcoming is an alias for --repo=upcoming Note that the repo selection affects which VCS paths you are allowed to build from. For example, you are not allowed to build from branches/osg-3.3 (from the OSG SVN) into the 'osg' repo, or from HCC's git repositories into the 'upcoming' repo. koji-tag-diff \u00b6 This script displays the differences between the latest packages in two koji tags. Example invocation: koji-tag-diff osg-3.4-el6-development osg-3.4-el7-testing This prints the packages that are in osg-3.4-el6-development but not in osg-3.4-el7-testing, or vice versa. osg-build-test \u00b6 This script runs automated tests for osg-build . Only a few tests have been implemented so far. osg-import-srpm \u00b6 This is a script to fetch an SRPM from a remote site, copy it into the upstream cache on AFS, and create an SVN package dir (if needed) with an upstream/*.source file. By default it will put downloaded files into the VDT upstream cache (/p/vdt/public/html/upstream), but you can pass --upstream-root=<UPSTREAM DIR> to put them somewhere else. If called with the --extract-spec or -e argument, it will extract the spec file from the SRPM and place it into the osg subdir in SVN. If called with the --diff-spec or -d argument, it will extract the spec file and compare it to the existing spec file in the osg subdir. The script hasn't been touched in a while and needs a good deal of cleanup. A planned feature is to allow doing a three-way diff between the existing RPM before OSG modifications, the new RPM before OSG modifications and the existing RPM after OSG modifications. osg-koji \u00b6 This is a wrapper script around the koji command line tool. It automatically specifies parameters to access the OSG's koji instance, and forces SSL authentication. It takes the same parameters as koji and passes them on. An additional command, osg-koji setup exists, which performs the following tasks: Create a koji configuration in ~/.osg-koji Create a CA bundle for verifying the server. Use either files in /etc/grid-security/certificates , or (if those are not found), from files downloaded from the DOEGrids and DigiCert sites. Create a client cert file. This can be a symlink to your grid proxy, or it can be a file created from your grid public and private key files. The location of those files can be specified by the --usercert and --userkey arguments. If unspecified, usercert defaults to ~/.globus/usercert.pem , and userkey defaults to ~/.globus/userkey.pem . osg-promote \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Run this script to push packages from one set of repos to another (e.g. from development to testing), according to the OSG software promotion guidelines. Once the packages are promoted, the script will generate code to cut and paste into a JIRA comment. Synopsis \u00b6 osg-promote [-r|--route <ROUTE>]... [options] <PACKAGE OR BUILD> [...] Examples \u00b6 Promote the latest build of osg-version to testing for the current release series osg-promote -r testing osg-version Promote the latest builds of osg-ce to testing for the 3.3 and 3.4 release series osg-promote -r 3.3-testing -r 3.4-testing osg-ce Promote osg-build-1.5.0-1 to testing for the current release series osg-promote -r testing osg-build-1.5.0-1 Arguments \u00b6 -h \u00b6 Display help and a list of valid routes. package or build \u00b6 A package (e.g. osg-version ) or build (e.g. osg-version-3.3.0-1.osg33.el6 ) to promote. You may omit the dist tag (the .osg33.el6 part). If a package is specified, the most recent version of that package will be promoted. If a build is specified, that build and the build that has the same version - release for the other distro version(s) will be promoted. That is, if you specify the route 3.3-testing and the build foo-1-1 , then foo-1-1.osg33.el6 and foo-1-1.osg33.el7 will be promoted. This may be specified multiple times, to promote multiple packages. The NVRs of each set of builds for a package must match. -r ROUTE , --route ROUTE \u00b6 The promotion route to use. Use osg-promote -h to get a list of valid routes. This may be specified multiple times. For example, to promote for both 3.4 and 3.3, pass -r 3.4-testing -r 3.3-testing . If not specified, the testing route is used, which corresponds to the testing route for the latest release series. -n, --dry-run \u00b6 Do not promote, just show what would be done. --el6-only / --el7-only \u00b6 Only promote packages for el6 / el7. --no-el6 / --no-el7 \u00b6 Do not promote packages for el6 / el7. --ignore-rejects \u00b6 Ignore rejections due to version mismatch between dvers or missing package for one dver. --regen \u00b6 Regenerate the destination repos after promoting. -y, --assume-yes \u00b6 Do not prompt before promotion. Common Usage Patterns \u00b6 Verify that all files necessary to build the package are in the right place \u00b6 Run osg-build prebuild <PACKAGEDIR> . Fetch and extract all source files for examination \u00b6 Run osg-build prebuild --full-extract <PACKAGEDIR> . Look inside the _upstream_tarball_contents directory. Get a post-patch version of the upstream sources for examination \u00b6 Run osg-build prepare <PACKAGEDIR> . Look inside the _build_results directory. See which patches work with a new version of a package, update or remove them \u00b6 Place the new source tarball into the upstream cache, edit the version in the spec file and *.sources files as necessary Run osg-build quilt <PACKAGEDIR> . Enter the extracted sources inside the _final_srpm_contents directory. You should see a file called series and a symlink called patches . Type quilt series to get a list of patches in order of application. Type quilt push to apply the next patch. If the patch applies cleanly, continue. If the patch applies with some fuzz, type quilt refresh to update the offsets in the patch. If the patch does not apply and you wish to remove it, type quilt delete <PATCH NAME> (delete only removes it from the series file, not the disk) If the patch does not apply and you wish to fix it, either type quilt push -f to interactively apply the patch, or quilt delete <PATCH NAME> the patch and use quilt new / quilt edit / quilt refresh to edit files and make a new patch from your changes. Consult the quilt(1) manpage for more info. If you have a new patch, run quilt import <PATCHFILE> to add the patch to the series file, and run quilt push to apply it. If you have changes to make to the source code that you want to save as a patch, type quilt new <PATCHNAME> , edit the files, type quilt add <FILE> on each file you edited, then type quilt refresh to recreate the patch. Once you're all done, copy the patches in the patches/ directory to the osg/ dir in SVN, run quilt series to get the application order and update the spec file accordingly. See if a package builds successfully for OSG 3.4 \u00b6 If you have all the build dependencies of the package installed, run osg-build rpmbuild <PACKAGEDIR> . The resulting RPMs will be in the _build_results directory. If you do not have all the build dependencies installed, or want to make sure you specified all of the necessary ones and the package builds from a clean environment, run osg-build mock --mock-config-from-koji osg-3.4-el6-build <PACKAGEDIR> . The resulting RPMs will be in the _build_results directory. If you do not have mock installed, or want to exactly replicate the build environment in Koji, run osg-build koji --scratch <PACKAGEDIR> . You may download the resulting RPMs from kojiweb https://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji or pass --getfiles to osg-build koji and they will get downloaded to the _build_results directory. Check for potential errors in a package \u00b6 Run osg-build lint <PACKAGEDIR> . Create and test a final build of a package for all platforms for upcoming \u00b6 svn commit your changes in branches/upcoming . Type osg-build koji --repo=upcoming <PACKAGEDIR> Wait for the osg-upcoming-minefield repos to be regenerated containing the new version of your package. You can run osg-koji wait-repo osg-upcoming-el<X>-development --build=<PACKAGENAME-VERSION-RELEASE> and wait for that process to finish (substitute 6 or 7 for X ). Or, you can just check kojiweb https://koji.opensciencegrid.org/koji/tasks . On your test machine, make sure the osg-upcoming-minefield repo is enabled (edit /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-upcoming-minefield.repo or /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6-upcoming-minefield.repo ). Clean your cache ( yum clean all; yum clean expire-cache ). Install your software, see if it works. Promote the latest build of a package to testing for the current OSG release series \u00b6 Run osg-promote -r testing <PACKAGE> Promote the latest build of a package to testing for the 3.3 and 3.4 release series \u00b6 Run osg-promote -r 3.3-testing -r 3.4-testing <PACKAGE>","title":"OSG Build Tools"},{"location":"software/osg-build-tools/#osg-build-tools","text":"This page documents the tools used for RPM development for the OSG Software Stack.

If the scope of this page broadens, be sure to update the title and/or this description. Slot Ad Attributes for Containers \u00b6 There are two seemingly similar Slot Ad attributes in the OSPool related to Singularity: HasSingularity is an HTCondor attribute that indicates whether jobs can run within Singularity containers. It is set to true based on a test that HTCondor performs at start-up, although subsequent container invocations could revoke the value upon certain failure conditions. HAS_SINGULARITY is an OSG pool attribute that indicates whether user payload jobs can and will run within Singularity containers. Only Singularity container runtimes are supported. It is set to true based on a test that is run in the pilot scripts. Note that the test is also baked into the OSPool Backfill Containers. The pilot-script test checks more conditions than the HTCondor HasSingularity one. Periodic scripts in the pilot (i.e., STARTD_CRON ) retest some of these conditions; thus, HAS_SINGULARITY may start out true but become false later in the pilot\u2019s lifetime. When an OSPool job asks to run inside a container, requirements are set to check that both HasSingularity and HAS_SINGULARITY are true for any matching Slot Ad. Containers and Pilots \u00b6 Obviously, Backfill Container \u201cpilots\u201d run inside a container runtime, although the specific choice of container runtime technology is up to the site. Within a GlideinWMS pilot, the pilot scripts determine whether a functioning Singularity container is available, which could come from a local install on each Execution Point or from CVMFS. If detected, then HAS_SINGULARITY is set to true and all user payloads will be run in containers. (It is possible to override this behavior through site-specific pilot hackery.) For Backfill Containers, the container itself includes an installation of Apptainer (n\u00e9e Singularity) and it will always be used (in unprivileged mode) instead of any system or other installation. The user job is a vanilla job. Today, though, a pilot runs the \u201cuser job wrapper\u201d script, which is a replacement for the user\u2019s executable that does some stuff and then runs the user\u2019s executable. If the HAS_SINGULARITY attribute is true in the environment of the wrapper, then it runs the actual user payload job in Singularity (or Apptainer). PID Namespaces \u00b6 PID namespaces are a key technology that enables containers to isolate from each other. See, for example, this Ubuntu copy of the man page for pid_namespaces . The root user always has the ability to create PID namespaces, so a privileged container runtime (i.e., not unprivileged Singularity) can always do this. There is a special feature for user PID namespaces , which can be created by unprivileged processes. To work, there is a certain kernel setting that must be set, and then user PID namespaces are available to all. Today, when the GlideinWMS user job wrapper is about to start a user payload job in a Singularity container, the default is to pass a flag to Singularity to use user PID namespaces. However, if user PID namespaces are not available (say, due to the kernel setting), the pilot start-up scripts do not detect this condition automatically. So, there is a special envirnoment variable that can be set on the outer container (e.g., the Backfill Container) to disable this flag: SINGULARITY_DISABLE_PID_NAMESPACES=1 While set on the outer container, it affects only the user job wrapper and how it invokes the inner Singularity container. Mat says that HTCondor 10.2.2 has a feature to detect the lack of user PID namespaces and, in such a case, to avoid using them, but it is not clear that that feature will help anything as long as the GlideinWMS user job wrapper is being used. Containers and GPUs \u00b6 Most, but certainly not all, OSPool payload jobs that request GPUs also request to run within a container. This is probably due to GPU-using software stacks often being complex, and so users often turn to containers for their runtime environment, including ones that we and others pre-build. Note that the Backfill Container images themselves do not include the NVIDIA CUDA drivers (although, we are experimenting with that). Instead, the CUDA drivers that are installed on the host system are mounted inside the running Backfill Container. This scheme, which works at most OSPool sites, allows GPU payload jobs to work without specifically requesting a container, although see above for why many do so anyway.","title":"OSPool Containers"},{"location":"software/ospool-containers/#containers-in-the-ospool","text":"Tim C. started this document in February 2023 to remember things from hallway discussions.

One of the following: The ability to run containers through tools like docker or podman An installation of oidc-agent available as an RPM from the OSG repositories Requesting Tokens Using a Container \u00b6 oidc-agent is a process that runs in the background that can request access and refresh tokens from OpenID Connect token providers. Registering an OIDC profile \u00b6 Start an agent container in the background and name it my-agent to easily run subsequent commands against it: docker run -d --name my-agent opensciencegrid/oidc-agent:3.6-release Generate a local client profile and follow the prompts: docker exec -it my-agent oidc-gen -w device <CLIENT PROFILE> Specify the WLCG INDIGO IAM instance as the client issuer: Issuer [https://iam-test.indigo-datacloud.eu/]: https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/ Request wlcg , offline_access , and other scopes for the capabilities that you need: Capability Scope HTCondor READ compute.read HTCondor WRITE compute.modify compute.cancel compute.create XRootD read storage.read:/ XRootD write storage.modify:/ For example, to request HTCondor READ and WRITE access, specify the following scopes: This issuer supports the following scopes: openid profile email address phone offline_access wlcg iam wlcg.groups Space delimited list of scopes or 'max' [openid profile offline_access]: wlcg offline_access compute.read compute.modify compute.cancel compute.create Note that, prior to HTCondor 8.9.7, the server also needed condor:/ALLOW in all cases. When prompted, open https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/device in a browser, enter the code provided by oidc-gen , and click \"Submit\". On the next page, verify the scopes and client profile name, and click \"Authorize\". Enter a password to encrypt your local client profile. You'll need to remember this if you want to re-use this profile in subsequent sessions. Requesting access tokens \u00b6 Note You must first register a new profile . Request a token using the client profile that you used with oidc-gen : docker exec -it my-agent oidc-token --aud=\"<SERVER AUDIENCE>\" <CLIENT PROFILE> For tokens used against an HTCondor-CE, set <SERVER AUDIENCE> to <CE FQDN>:<CE PORT> . Copy the output of oidc-token into a file on the host where you need SciToken authentication, e.g. an HTCondor or XRootD client. Reloading an OIDC profile \u00b6 Note Required after restarting the running container. You must have an existing registered profile . If your existing container is not already running, start it: docker start my-agent Reload profile: docker exec -it my-agent oidc-add <CLIENT PROFILE> Enter password used to encrypt your <CLIENT PROFILE> created during profile registration. Requesting Tokens with an RPM installation \u00b6 Registering an OIDC profile \u00b6 Start the agent and add the appropriate variables to your environment: eval `oidc-agent` Generate a local client profile and follow the prompts: oidc-gen -w device <CLIENT PROFILE> Specify the WLCG INDIGO IAM instance as the client issuer: Issuer [https://iam-test.indigo-datacloud.eu/]: https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/ Request wlcg , offline_access , and other scopes for the capabilities that you need: Capability Scope HTCondor READ compute.read HTCondor WRITE compute.modify compute.cancel compute.create XRootD read read:/ XRootD write write:/ For example, to request HTCondor READ and WRITE access, specify the following scopes: This issuer supports the following scopes: openid profile email address phone offline_access wlcg iam wlcg.groups Space delimited list of scopes or 'max' [openid profile offline_access]: wlcg offline_access compute.read compute.modify compute.cancel compute.create Note that, prior to HTCondor 8.9.7, the server also needed condor:/ALLOW in all cases.

I resurrected it into epelrescue-el5. Later, EPEL put rpmdevtools back into their repos, so it no longer needed to be in epelrescue-el5. I used block-pkg on rpmdevtools in epelrescue-el5, thinking that the package could remain tagged, but will stay out of our repos, and the EPEL package would be used instead. The block not only hid our rpmdevtools, it hid EPEL's rpmdevtools as well, preventing us from being able to build. I unblocked the rpmdevtools, and just untagged the build instead, regenerated our build repos, and we could build again.

The procedures, conventions, and policies defined within are used by the OSG Software Team, and are recommended to all external developers who wish to contribute to the OSG Software Stack. Principles \u00b6 The principles below guide the design and implementation of the technical details that follow. Packages should adhere to community standards (e.g., Fedora Packaging Guidelines when possible, and significant deviations must be documented Every released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system Source code for software should be clearly separable from the packaging of that software Upstream source files (which should not be modified) should be clearly separated from files owned by the OSG Software Team Building source and binary packages from our system should be easy and efficient External developers should have a clear and effective system for developing and contributing packages We should use standard tools from relevant packaging and development communities when appropriate Contributing Packages \u00b6 We encourage all interested parties to contribute to OSG Software, and all the infrastructure described on this page should be friendly to external contributors. To participate in the packaging community: You must subscribe to the software-discuss@osg-htc.org email list. To create and edit packages: Obtain access to VDT SVN . To upload new source tarballs: You must have a cs.wisc.edu account with write access to the VDT source tarball directory. Email the osg-software list and request permission. To build using the OSG's Koji build system: You must have a valid personal certificate and a Koji account. To obtain the Koji account, email the osg-software list with your cert's DN and request permission. Development Infrastructure \u00b6 This section documents most of what a developer needs to know about our RPM infrastructure: Upstream Source Cache \u2014 a filesystem scheme for caching upstream source files Revision Control System \u2014 where to get and store development files, and how they are organized Build System \u2014 how to build packages from the revision control system Yum Repository \u2014 the location and organization of our Yum repository, and how to promote packages through it Upstream Source Cache \u00b6 One of our principles (every released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system) creates a potential issue: If we keep all historical source data, especially upstream files like source tarballs and source RPMs, in our revision control system, we may face large checkouts and consequently long checkout and update times. Our solution is to cache all upstream source files in a separate filesystem area, retaining historical files indefinitely. To avoid tainting upstream files, our policy is to leave them unmodified after download. Locating Files in the Cache \u00b6 Upstream source files are stored in the filesystem as follows: /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/<PACKAGE>/<VERSION>/<FILE> where: Symbol Definition Example <PACKAGE> Upstream name of the source package, or some widely accepted form thereof ndt <VERSION> Upstream version string used to identify the release 3.6.4 <FILE> Upstream filename itself ndt-3.6.4.tar.gz The authoritative cache is the VDT webserver, which is fully backed up. The Koji build system uses this cache. Upstream source files are referenced from within the revision control system; see below for details. You will need to know the SHA1 checksum of any files you use from the cache. Do get it, do: $ sha1sum /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/<PACKAGE>/<VERSION>/<FILE> Contributing Upstream Files \u00b6 You must make sure that any new upstream source files are cached on the VDT webserver before building the package via Koji. You have two options: If you have access to a UW\u2013Madison CSL machine, you can scp the source files directly into the AFS locations using that machine If you do not have such access, write to the osg-software list to find someone who will post the files for you Git/GitHub Hosted Upstream Files \u00b6 It is also possible to pull sources and spec files from remote Git or GitHub repos instead of our source cache. See the upstream dir info for more information. Revision Control System \u00b6 All packages that the OSG Software Team releases are checked into our Subversion repository. Subversion Access \u00b6 Our Subversion repository is located at: https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn Procedure for offsite users obtaining access to Subversion Or, from a UW\u2013Madison Computer Sciences machine: file:///p/condor/workspaces/vdt/svn The current SVN directory housing our native package work is $SVN/native/redhat (where $SVN is one of the ways of accessing our SVN repository above). For example, to check out the current package repository via HTTPS, do: [you@host]$ svn co https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native/redhat OSG-Owned Software \u00b6 OSG-owned software goes into GitHub under the opensciencegrid organization. Files are organized as the developer sees fit. It is strongly recommended that each software package include a top-level Makefile with at least the following targets: Symbol Purpose install Install the software into final FHS locations rooted at DESTDIR dist Create a distribution source tarball (in the current section directory) for a release upstream Install the distribution source tarball into the upstream source cache Packaging Top-Level Directory Organization \u00b6 The top levels of our Subversion directory hierarchy for packaging are as follows: native/redhat/<SECTION>/<PACKAGE> where: Symbol Definition Example <SECTION> Development section Standard Subversion sections like trunk and branches/* <PACKAGE> Our standardized name for a source package ndt Package Directory Organization \u00b6 Within a source package directory, the following files (detailed in separate sections below) may exist: README text file package notes, by and for developers upstream/ directory references to the upstream source cache and other kinds of upstream files osg/ directory overrides and patches of upstream files, plus new files, which contribute to the final OSG source package README \u00b6 This is a free-form text file for developers to leave notes about the package. Please document anything interesting about how you procured the upstream source, the reasons for the modifications you made, or anything else people might need to know in order to maintain the package in the future. Please document the why , not just the what . upstream \u00b6 Within the per-package directories of the revision control system, there must be a way to refer to cached files. This is done with small text files that (a) are named consistently, and (b) contain the location of the referenced file as its contents. A reference file is named: <DESCRIPTION>.<TYPE>.source where: Symbol Definition Example <DESCRIPTION> Descriptive label of the source of the referenced file developer , epel , emi <TYPE> Type of referenced file tarball , srpm and contain references to cached files, Git repos, and comments. which start with # and continue until the end of the line. It is useful to add the source of the upstream file into a comment.

Example The reference file for globus-common 's source tarball is named epel.srpm.source and contains: globus-common/16.4/globus-common-16.4-1.el6.src.rpm sha1sum=134478c56c2437c335c20636831f794b66290bec # Downloaded from 'http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/SRPMS/globus-common-16.4-1.el6.src.rpm' GitHub repos \u00b6 Warning OSG software policy requires that all Git and GitHub repos used for building software have mirrors at the UW.

In addition, if the repository contains a file called rpm/<PROJECT>.spec , it will be used as the spec file for the build (unless overridden in the osg directory). Git repos \u00b6 Warning OSG software policy requires that all Git and GitHub repos used for building software have mirrors at the UW. Many software repos under the opensciencegrid GitHub organization are already mirrored. If you are uncertain, or have a new project that you want mirrored, send email to technology-team@osg-htc.org . Note You can use a shorter syntax for GitHub repos -- see above. See also advanced features for Git and GitHub repos . To reference tags in Git repos, use the following syntax (all on one line): type=git url=<URL> name=<NAME> tag=<TAG> hash=<HASH> where: Symbol Definition Example <URL> Location of the Git repo https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build.git <NAME> Name of the software (optional) osg-build <TAG> Git tag to use v1.11.2 <HASH> Full 40-char Git hash of the tag 5bcf48c442d21b1e8c93a468d884f84122f7cc9e Note <NAME> is optional; if not present, OSG-Build will use the last component of the URL, without the .git suffix. The tarball will be called <NAME>-<VERSION>.tar.gz where <VERSION> is <TAG> without the v prefix (if there is one). Example The reference file for osg-build 's repo is named osg.github.source and contains: type=git url=https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build.git name=osg-build tag=v1.11.2 hash=5bcf48c442d21b1e8c93a468d884f84122f7cc9e This results in a tarball named osg-build-1.11.2.tar.gz . In addition, if the repository contains a file called rpm/<NAME>.spec , it will be used as the spec file for the build (unless overridden in the osg directory). Typical workflow when building out of GitHub repos \u00b6 Fork the repository of the package that you would like to build Create a new branch in your fork Make, commit, and push changes to your new branch In your fork, tag the commit that you would like to build In the upstream/osg.github.source , change the repo to point at your fork and tag Attempt a scratch build If the build fails, remove the tag and repeat steps 3-6 Submit a PR to merge changes upstream Tag the final version on the upstream fork Build the version that will go through the normal software cycle Note Packaging-only changes should be tagged with a release number of the format v<version>-<release> , e.g. v3.4.23-2 Advanced features for Git and GitHub repos \u00b6 The following features make software development in Git and GitHub more convenient: Support for RPM release numbers in Git tags: If the tag for the software contains a dash, as in v1.12.2-1 , it is assumed that the text after the dash is the RPM release instead of the software version. The RPM release is not included in the tarball. That is, the project osg-build with the tag v1.12.2-1 will result in a tarball named osg-build-1.12.1.tar.gz , not osg-build-1.12.1-1.tar.gz . Can specify tarball name in the .source file: The new tarball attribute allows you to specify the name of the tarball and directory that the repo contents will be put into. The syntax is tarball=<NAME>.tar.gz . The extension must be .tar.gz , no other archive formats are supported. The directory inside the tarball will then be <NAME>/ . Can ignore hash mismatch (scratch and local builds only): For local builds (rpmbuild and mock tasks) and Koji scratch builds, a hash mismatch will result in a warning. Non-scratch Koji builds will still consider it an error. Can use a branch as the tag: The tag attribute can refer to a branch instead of a tag, e.g. tag=master . Combining the last two features can really speed up package development. For example, you can use this to make scratch builds of the current master: type=github repo=<OWNER>/<PROJECT> tarball=<PROJECT>-<VERSION>.tar.gz tag=master hash=0 This might also be useful as part of a continuous integration scheme (e.g. Travis-CI). osg \u00b6 The osg directory contains files that are owned by the OSG Software Team and that are used to create the final, released source package. It may contain a variety of development files: An RPM .spec file, which overrides any spec file from a referenced source Patch ( .patch ) or replacement files, which override any same-named file from the top-level directory of a referenced source Other files, which must be explicitly placed into the package by the spec file Generated directories \u00b6 The following directories may be generated by our build tool, OSG-Build . They are not under revision control. _upstream_srpm_contents/ expanded contents of a cached upstream source package _upstream_tarball_contents/ expanded contents of all cached upstream source tarballs _final_srpm_contents/ the final contents of the OSG source package _build_results/ OSG source and binary packages resulting from a build _quilt/ expanded, patched contents of the upstream sources, as generated by the quilt tool _upstream_srpm_contents \u00b6 The _upstream_srpm_contents directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source package. It is a volatile record of the upstream source for developer use. _upstream_tarball_contents \u00b6 The _upstream_tarball_contents directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source tarballs. It is generated by the package build tool if the --full-extract option is passed. It is not used for anything by the build tool, but meant as a convenience to allow the developer to look inside the upstream sources (for making patches, etc.). _final_srpm_contents \u00b6 The _final_srpm_contents directory contains the final files that are part of the released source package. It is a volatile record of a build for developer use. _build_results \u00b6 The _build_results directory contains the source and binary RPMs that are produced by a local build. It is a volatile record of a build for developer use. _quilt \u00b6 The _quilt directory contains the unpacked sources after they have been patched using the quilt utility. This allows easier patch development. Packaging Organization Examples \u00b6 Use Case 1: Packaging an Upstream Source Tarball \u00b6 When the OSG Software Team packages an upstream source tarball, for which there is no existing package, the source tarball is referenced with a .source file and we provide a spec file and, if necessary, patches. For example, RSV is provided as a source tarball only. Its package directory contains: rsv/ osg/ rsv.spec upstream/ developer.tarball.source Use Case 2: Passing Through a Source RPM \u00b6 When the OSG Software Team simply provides a copy of an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and that is it. For example, we do not modify the globus-common source RPM from EPEL. Its package directory contains: globus-common/ upstream/ epel.srpm.source Use Case 3: Modifying a Source RPM \u00b6 When the OSG Software Team modifies an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and then all changes to the upstream source are contained in the osg directory. For example, we use this mechanism for the globus-ftp-client package, originally obtained from EPEL. Its package directory contains: globus-ftp-client/ osg/ globus-ftp-client.spec 1853-ssh-bin.patch upstream/ epel.srpm.source Build Process \u00b6 All necessary information to create the package will be committed to the VDT source code repository (see below) The OSG build tools will take those files, create a source RPM, and submit it to our Koji build system Developers may use rpmbuild and mock for faster iterative development before submitting the package to Koji. osg-build may be used as a wrapper script around rpmbuild and mock . OSG Software Repository \u00b6 OSG Operations maintains the Yum repositories that contain our source and binary RPMs at https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/ and are mirrored at other institutions as well. Release Levels \u00b6 Every package is classified into a release level based on the amount of testing it has undergone and our confidence in its stability. When a package is first built, it goes into the lowest level ( osg-development ). The members of the OSG Software and Release teams may promote packages through the release levels, as per our Release Policy page . Packaging Conventions \u00b6 In addition to adhering to the Fedora Packaging Guidelines (FPG), we have a few rules and guidelines of our own: When we pass-through an RPM and make any changes to it (so it has an updated package number), we construct the version-release as follows: The version of the original RPM remains unchanged The release is composed of three parts: ORIGINALRELEASE.OSGRELEASE We add a distro tag based on the OSG major version and OS major version, e.g. \"osg33.el6\". (Use %{?dist} in the Release field) Example: We copy package foobar-3.0.5-1 from somewhere. We need to patch it, so the full name-version-release (NVR) for OSG 3.3 on EL 6 becomes foobar-3.0.5-1.1.osg33.el6 Note that we added \".1.osg33.el6\" to the release number. If we update our packaging (but still base on foobar-3.0.5-1), we change to \".2.osg33.el6\". In the spec file, this would look like: Release : 1.2 %{?dist} Packaging for Multiple Distro Versions \u00b6 Conditionalizing spec files \u00b6 Some packages may need different build behavior between major versions of the OS; RPM conditional statements will be used to handle this. The following macros are defined: Name Value (EL6) Value (EL7) %rhel 6 7 %el6 1 undefined or 0 %el7 undefined or 0 1 Here's how to use them: %if 0%{?el6} # this code will be executed on EL 6 only %endif %if 0%{?el7} # this code will be executed on EL 7 only %endif %if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 # this code will be executed on EL 7 and newer %endif (There does not seem to be an %elseif ). The syntax %{?el6} expands to the value of the %el6 macro if it is defined, and to the empty string if not; the 0 is there to keep the condition from being empty in the %if statement if the macro is not defined. Renaming or Removing Packages \u00b6 Occasionally we want to cause a package to be removed on update, or replaced by a package with a different name. For the most part, the Fedora Packaging Guidelines page on renames shows how to do that. The exception is that we do not have the equivalent of a fedora-obsolete-packages package, so in order to force the removal of an entire package (not a subpackage), we have to dummy out the package instead -- see below. (This should be a rare situation.) Note After doing a rename or a removal, you must update all the packages and subpackages that require the package being removed or renamed, and change or remove the requirements as appropriate. To find packages that require the old package at run time, set up a host with the OSG repos and install the yum-utils RPM. On EL8 and newer, run: $ repoquery --whatrequires $OLDPACKAGE On EL7, run $ repoquery --plugins --whatrequires $OLDPACKAGE To find packages that require the old package at build time, install osg-build , and do this from a checkout of the OSG repos: $ osg-build prebuild * $ for srpm in */_final_srpm_contents/*.src.rpm ; do \\ echo \"***** $srpm *****\"; \\ rpm -q --requires -p $srpm | grep -w $OLDPACKAGE; \\ done (examine the output to avoid false matches) Note Carefully test these changes, including places where the old package may be brought in indirectly. Dummying out a package \u00b6 In order to forcibly remove an entire package with no replacement, you have to replace the package with one that does nothing. This is because there is no package that will \"obsolete\" the old package. Do the following for the main package and any subpackages it may have: Change the Summary to \"Dummy package\" Change the %description to: This is an empty package created for $REASONS It may safely be removed. Where $REASONS is a description of why you need this dummy package Remove all Requires and Obsoletes lines Do not remove Provides lines Remove %pre and %post scriptlets Unless there is a good reason not to, remove %preun and %postun scriptlets Empty the %files section","title":"RPM Development Guide"},{"location":"software/rpm-development-guide/#rpm-development-guide","text":"This page documents technical guidelines and details about RPM development for the OSG Software Stack.

(Use %{?dist} in the Release field) Example: We copy package foobar-3.0.5-1 from somewhere. We need to patch it, so the full name-version-release (NVR) for OSG 3.3 on EL 6 becomes foobar-3.0.5-1.1.osg33.el6 Note that we added \".1.osg33.el6\" to the release number.

(This should be a rare situation.) Note After doing a rename or a removal, you must update all the packages and subpackages that require the package being removed or renamed, and change or remove the requirements as appropriate. To find packages that require the old package at run time, set up a host with the OSG repos and install the yum-utils RPM.
